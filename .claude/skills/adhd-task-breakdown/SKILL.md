# ADHD Task Breakdown

## When to use this skill:

- Breaking down large tasks into atomic, manageable subtasks
- Creating todo lists with clear priorities and statuses
- Organizing code snippets and reusable patterns
- Making focused, small commits for better tracking
- Managing ADHD-friendly development workflows
- Creating structured approaches to complex problems
- Organizing project files and directories logically
- Setting up reminders and task tracking systems
- Managing context switching and focus periods
- Creating reusable templates and patterns for consistency

## Best Practices
- Use todowrite: high priority atomic subtasks; one in_progress.
- Snippets: hosts/zephyrus/nixos-snippets.nix let snippets = { deploy = ...; };
- Commits: &quot;feat(module): add X&quot;; git add specific file.
