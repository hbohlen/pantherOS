        "content": "# pantherOS - Declarative NixOS Configuration\n\nA personal, multi-host NixOS configuration for solo developer infrastructure. This repository manages configurations for multiple workstations and servers with a modular, flake-based approach.\n\n## 🎯 Overview\n\nThis project provides a **declarative, modular, and reproducible** framework for managing personal development infrastructure. It solves the problem of configuration drift between devices and servers by providing a single source of truth for all system configurations.\n\n## 🖥️ Managed Hosts\n\n### Workstations\n- **yoga** - Lenovo Yoga 7 2-in-1 (battery-optimized, lightweight development)\n- **zephyrus** - ASUS ROG Zephyrus M16 (performance workstation, heavy development workflows)\n\n### Servers\n- **hetzner-vps** - Hetzner Cloud VPS (primary development server)\n- **ovh-vps** - OVH Cloud VPS (secondary server)\n\n## 📚 Documentation\n\nComplete documentation is available in the [docs/](./docs/) directory:\n\n- [Getting Started Guide](./docs/guides/getting-started.md) - Initial setup and basic usage\n- [Architecture Guide](./docs/guides/architecture.md) - System design and structure\n- [Module Development Guide](./docs/guides/module-development.md) - Creating and maintaining modules\n- [Tutorials](./docs/tutorials/) - Step-by-step guides for specific tasks\n- [Reference Materials](./docs/reference/) - Quick reference and specifications\n- [Troubleshooting](./docs/troubleshooting/) - Common issues and solutions\n\nFor AI agents working with this codebase, see the [Project Primer](./docs/context/project-primer.md).\n\n## 🚀 Quick Start\n\n### Prerequisites\n- NixOS installed on target machines\n- 1Password account with service account configured\n- Access to Tailscale Tailnet\n\n### Deployment\n\n1. **Clone this repository**\n   ```bash\n   git clone <repository-url>\n   cd pantherOS\n   ```\n\n2. **Configure 1Password service account**\n   - Ensure `opnix` is configured with your `pantherOS` service account\n   - Verify vault access: `op nix list-items pantherOS`\n\n3. **Deploy to a host**\n   ```bash\n   # For yoga workstation\n   nixos-rebuild switch --flake .#yoga\n\n   # For zephyrus workstation\n   nixos-rebuild switch --flake .#zephyrus\n\n   # For hetzner VPS\n   nixos-rebuild switch --flake .#hetzner-vps\n\n   # For ovh VPS\n   nixos-rebuild switch --flake .#ovh-vps\n   ```\n\n## 🛠️ Development\n\n### Working on Configuration\n\n1. **Create a new module**\n   ```bash\n   # System module\n   touch modules/nixos/services/my-service.nix\n\n   # Check the Module Development Guide for patterns\n   # See: docs/guides/module-development.md\n   ```\n\n2. **Add module to a host**\n   Edit `hosts/<hostname>/default.nix`:\n   ```nix\n   {\n     imports = [\n       ./disko.nix\n       ./hardware.nix\n\n       # Add your new module\n       ../../modules/nixos/services/my-service.nix\n     ];\n   }\n   ```\n\n3. **Test configuration**\n   ```bash\n   nixos-rebuild build --flake .#<hostname>\n   ```\n\n### Development Shell\n\nA fully configured development environment is available:\n```bash\nnix develop\n```\n\nThis provides all necessary tools for working on the configuration, including Nix language servers, formatters, and development utilities.\n\n## 🔒 Security\n\n### Secrets Management\n- All secrets are managed through 1Password service account\n- Reference format: `op:<vault>/<item>/<section>/<field>`\n- Never commit secrets to the repository\n- Use OpNix for NixOS integration\n\n### Network Security\n- All hosts operate within a Tailscale Tailnet\n- Firewall rules configured per host type\n- SSH access restricted to Tailnet devices\n- No public-facing services (except through reverse proxy with Tailnet access)\n\n## 🧩 OpenSpec Change Management\n\nThis project uses OpenSpec for structured change management. See the [Specification Documentation](./docs/specs/specifications.md) and individual proposals in `openspec/changes/` for details on planned and implemented changes.\n\n## 📝 License\n\nPersonal configuration repository. See repository license for details.\n\n## 🆘 Support\n\nFor issues or questions:\n1. Check documentation in [docs/](./docs/)\n2. Review existing issues\n3. Create new issue with:\n   - Host affected\n   - Error messages\n   - Steps to reproduce\n   - Expected behavior\n\n---\n\n**Built with ❤️ using NixOS**"

This file should define the `nixosConfigurations.hetzner-vps` attribute that references the host configuration.\n\n2. **Missing Hardware Configuration**: The `hosts/servers/hetzner-vps/hardware.nix` file exists but is empty. This should contain hardware-specific configuration for the Hetzner VPS.\n\n## 📋 Steps Required for Deployment Readiness\n\nTo make the pantherOS ready for Hetzner Cloud deployment, you need to:\n\n1. **Create a proper flake.nix file** with nixosConfigurations that includes the hetzner-vps:\n   ```nix\n   {\n     description = \"pantherOS - Declarative NixOS Configuration\";\n     \n     inputs = {\n       nixpkgs.url = \"github:NixOS/nixpkgs/nixos-unstable\";\n       # ... other inputs\n     };\n     \n     outputs = { self, nixpkgs, ... }: {\n       nixosConfigurations.hetzner-vps = nixpkgs.lib.nixosSystem {\n         system = \"x86_64-linux\";\n         modules = [\n           ./hosts/servers/hetzner-vps\n           # ... other modules\n         ];\n       };\n     };\n   }\n   ```\n\n2. **Complete the hardware.nix file** for Hetzner VPS with appropriate hardware configuration.\n\n## 🎯 Verdict\n\n**Currently NOT ready for deployment** due to the missing flake definition, which is essential for building and deploying the configuration. However, with the comprehensive disk layout and basic system configuration already in place, it would require only completing the flake.nix file and hardware.nix to make it deployable.\n\nOnce these critical components are added, the impermanence design and security features implemented in the configuration will provide a robust foundation for a Hetzner Cloud deployment."

This blocks the standard NixOS deployment workflow and prevents utilization of the primary development server infrastructure.\n\n## What Changes\n- Create working basic NixOS server configuration for Hetzner VPS\n- Implement functional disko configuration for disk setup with Btrfs\n- Add hardware.nix template with server-specific optimizations\n- Integrate Hetzner VPS into flake.nix outputs for deployment\n- Configure basic security (SSH hardening, Tailscale integration)\n- Enable essential services (Podman, networking basics)\n\n## Impact\n- Affected specs: nixos-base-configuration (new capability)\n- Affected code:\n  - `hosts/servers/hetzner-vps/default.nix` (implementation)\n  - `hosts/servers/hetzner-vps/disko.nix` (implementation)\n  - `hosts/servers/hetzner-vps/hardware.nix` (implementation)\n  - `flake.nix` (integration)\n- Dependencies: Hardware discovery documentation, disk layout architecture\n- Benefits: Enables immediate deployment workflow, provides foundation for server services, establishes base infrastructure pattern"

Without a proper flake definition, the nixosConfigurations for all hosts (including hetzner-vps, yoga, zephyrus) cannot be built or deployed. This makes the current repository non-functional for its primary purpose of managing NixOS configurations across multiple hosts.\\n\\n## What Changes\\n- Create a complete flake.nix file with proper inputs and outputs\\n- Define nixosConfigurations for all existing hosts: yoga, zephyrus, hetzner-vps, ovh-vps\\n- Integrate existing host configurations from the hosts/ directory\\n- Add necessary flake inputs: nixpkgs, disko, nixos-hardware, home-manager\\n- Implement development environment outputs for contributors\\n\\n## Impact\\n- Affected specs: core-flake-structure (new capability)\\n- Affected code:\\n  - `flake.nix` (creation of complete flake definition)\\n  - All host configurations in `hosts/` (integration into flake)\\n- Dependencies: Hardware profiles, module configurations, disko configurations\\n- Benefits: Enables deployment workflow for all hosts, provides proper NixOS flake integration\"}"

          "content": "<scratchpad>\nLet me think through the entire history and what has been accomplished:\n\n1. The user asked if pantherOS was ready enough to try and deploy to Hetzner Cloud.\n\n2. I analyzed the current state and found that while the repository had configurations for Hetzner VPS, the main flake.nix file was completely empty, which is critical for deployment.\n\n3. I discovered there was already a proposal for Hetzner VPS core configuration, but the flake integration task was incomplete.\n\n4. I created a new OpenSpec proposal for implementing the core flake structure, with specs and tasks.\n\n5. I implemented the complete flake.nix file with proper inputs (nixpkgs, disko, nixos-hardware, home-manager) and nixosConfigurations for all hosts (yoga, zephyrus, hetzner-vps, ovh-vps).\n\n6. I updated the hardware.nix file for hetzner-vps with server-specific hardware settings appropriate for a Hetzner Cloud VPS.\n\n7. I validated the implementation by checking file paths and structures.\n\nThe overall goal was to make pantherOS ready for Hetzner Cloud deployment by implementing the missing flake structure and completing the Hetzner VPS hardware configuration.\n\nKey knowledge gained:\n- The flake.nix file was the critical missing component preventing deployment\n- The repository uses OpenSpec methodology for change management\n- All host configurations exist in the hosts/ directory\n- The home-manager configuration is located at home/hbohlen/default.nix\n\nFile system state:\n- Created: openspec/changes/flake-structure-implementation/ with proposal, specs, and tasks\n- Modified: flake.nix now contains complete flake definition\n- Modified: hosts/servers/hetzner-vps/hardware.nix now contains server-specific configuration\n\nCurrent plan:\n1. [DONE] Create OpenSpec proposal for flake structure implementation\n2. [DONE] Implement complete flake.nix file\n3. [DONE] Update hetzner-vps hardware.nix\n4. [DONE] Validate implementation\n</scratchpad>\n\n<state_snapshot>\n    <overall_goal>\n        Make pantherOS ready for Hetzner Cloud deployment by implementing the missing flake structure and completing the Hetzner VPS hardware configuration.\n    </overall_goal>\n\n    <key_knowledge>\n        - The main flake.nix file was completely empty, which was the critical issue preventing any deployments\n        - Repository follows OpenSpec methodology for change management\n        - Host configurations exist in hosts/ directory with subdirectories for yoga, zephyrus, and servers\n        - Server configurations are in hosts/servers/ with hetzner-vps and ovh-cloud subdirectories\n        - Home-manager configuration is located at home/hbohlen/default.nix, not home/default.nix\n        - All host configurations require disko, home-manager, and proper hardware modules\n        - The implementation follows NixOS flake standards with proper inputs and nixosConfigurations\n    </key_knowledge>\n\n    <file_system_state>\n        - CWD: /home/hbohlen/dev/pantherOS\n        - CREATED: openspec/changes/flake-structure-implementation/ with proposal.md, specs/core-flake-structure.md, and tasks.md\n        - MODIFIED: flake.nix now contains complete flake definition with inputs and nixosConfigurations for all hosts\n        - MODIFIED: hosts/servers/hetzner-vps/hardware.nix now contains server-specific hardware configuration for Hetzner Cloud VPS\n        - VERIFIED: All required host configurations exist (hosts/yoga/, hosts/zephyrus/, hosts/servers/hetzner-vps/, hosts/servers/ovh-cloud/)\n        - VERIFIED: Home-manager configuration exists at home/hbohlen/default.nix\n    </file_system_state>\n\n    <recent_actions>\n        - Created OpenSpec proposal for flake structure implementation in openspec/changes/flake-structure-implementation/\n        - Implemented complete flake.nix file with proper inputs (nixpkgs, disko, nixos-hardware, home-manager) and nixosConfigurations for all hosts\n        - Updated hosts/servers/hetzner-vps/hardware.nix with server-specific hardware settings\n        - Verified all host configuration paths and home-manager configuration path\n        - Corrected home-manager path in flake.nix from ./home/default.nix to ./home/hbohlen/default.nix\n    </recent_actions>\n\n    <current_plan>\n        1.
