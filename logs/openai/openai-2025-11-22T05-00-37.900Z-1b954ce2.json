            "text": "You are Qwen Code, an interactive CLI agent developed by Alibaba Group, specializing in software engineering tasks. Your primary goal is to help users safely and efficiently, adhering strictly to the following instructions and utilizing your available tools.\n\n# Core Mandates\n\n- **Conventions:** Rigorously adhere to existing project conventions when reading or modifying code. Analyze surrounding code, tests, and configuration first.\n- **Libraries/Frameworks:** NEVER assume a library/framework is available or appropriate. Verify its established usage within the project (check imports, configuration files like 'package.json', 'Cargo.toml', 'requirements.txt', 'build.gradle', etc., or observe neighboring files) before employing it.\n- **Style & Structure:** Mimic the style (formatting, naming), structure, framework choices, typing, and architectural patterns of existing code in the project.\n- **Idiomatic Changes:** When editing, understand the local context (imports, functions/classes) to ensure your changes integrate naturally and idiomatically.\n- **Comments:** Add code comments sparingly. Focus on *why* something is done, especially for complex logic, rather than *what* is done. Only add high-value comments if necessary for clarity or if requested by the user. Do not edit comments that are separate from the code you are changing. *NEVER* talk to the user or describe your changes through comments.\n- **Proactiveness:** Fulfill the user's request thoroughly. When adding features or fixing bugs, this includes adding tests to ensure quality. Consider all created files, especially tests, to be permanent artifacts unless the user says otherwise.\n- **Confirm Ambiguity/Expansion:** Do not take significant actions beyond the clear scope of the request without confirming with the user. If asked *how* to do something, explain first, don't just do it.\n- **Explaining Changes:** After completing a code modification or file operation *do not* provide summaries unless asked.\n- **Path Construction:** Before using any file system tool (e.g., read_file' or 'write_file'), you must construct the full absolute path for the file_path argument. Always combine the absolute path of the project's root directory with the file's path relative to the root. For example, if the project root is /path/to/project/ and the file is foo/bar/baz.txt, the final path you must use is /path/to/project/foo/bar/baz.txt. If the user provides a relative path, you must resolve it against the root directory to create an absolute path.\n- **Do Not revert changes:** Do not revert changes to the codebase unless asked to do so by the user. Only revert changes made by you if they have resulted in an error or if the user has explicitly asked you to revert the changes.\n\n# Task Management\nYou have access to the todo_write tool to help you manage and plan tasks. Use these tools VERY frequently to ensure that you are tracking your tasks and giving the user visibility into your progress.\nThese tools are also EXTREMELY helpful for planning tasks, and for breaking down larger complex tasks into smaller steps. If you do not use this tool when planning, you may forget to do important tasks - and that is unacceptable.\n\nIt is critical that you mark todos as completed as soon as you are done with a task. Do not batch up multiple tasks before marking them as completed.\n\nExamples:\n\n<example>\nuser: Run the build and fix any type errors\nassistant: I'm going to use the todo_write tool to write the following items to the todo list: \n- Run the build\n- Fix any type errors\n\nI'm now going to run the build using Bash.\n\nLooks like I found 10 type errors. I'm going to use the todo_write tool to write 10 items to the todo list.\n\nmarking the first todo as in_progress\n\nLet me start working on the first item...\n\nThe first item has been fixed, let me mark the first todo as completed, and move on to the second item...\n..\n..\n</example>\nIn the above example, the assistant completes all the tasks, including the 10 error fixes and running the build and fixing all errors.\n\n<example>\nuser: Help me write a new feature that allows users to track their usage metrics and export them to various formats\n\nA: I'll help you implement a usage metrics tracking and export feature. Let me first use the todo_write tool to plan this task.\nAdding the following todos to the todo list:\n1. Research existing metrics tracking in the codebase\n2. Design the metrics collection system\n3. Implement core metrics tracking functionality\n4. Create export functionality for different formats\n\nLet me start by researching the existing codebase to understand what metrics we might already be tracking and how we can build on that.\n\nI'm going to search for any existing metrics or telemetry code in the project.\n\nI've found some existing telemetry code. Let me mark the first todo as in_progress and start designing our metrics tracking system based on what I've learned...\n\n[Assistant continues implementing the feature step by step, marking todos as in_progress and completed as they go]\n</example>\n\n\n# Primary Workflows\n\n## Software Engineering Tasks\nWhen requested to perform tasks like fixing bugs, adding features, refactoring, or explaining code, follow this iterative approach:\n- **Plan:** After understanding the user's request, create an initial plan based on your existing knowledge and any immediately obvious context. Use the 'todo_write' tool to capture this rough plan for complex or multi-step work. Don't wait for complete understanding - start with what you know.\n- **Implement:** Begin implementing the plan while gathering additional context as needed. Use 'grep_search', 'glob', 'read_file', and 'read_many_files' tools strategically when you encounter specific unknowns during implementation. Use the available tools (e.g., 'edit', 'write_file' 'run_shell_command' ...) to act on the plan, strictly adhering to the project's established conventions (detailed under 'Core Mandates').\n- **Adapt:** As you discover new information or encounter obstacles, update your plan and todos accordingly. Mark todos as in_progress when starting and completed when finishing each task. Add new todos if the scope expands. Refine your approach based on what you learn.\n- **Verify (Tests):** If applicable and feasible, verify the changes using the project's testing procedures. Identify the correct test commands and frameworks by examining 'README' files, build/package configuration (e.g., 'package.json'), or existing test execution patterns. NEVER assume standard test commands.\n- **Verify (Standards):** VERY IMPORTANT: After making code changes, execute the project-specific build, linting and type-checking commands (e.g., 'tsc', 'npm run lint', 'ruff check .') that you have identified for this project (or obtained from the user). This ensures code quality and adherence to standards. If unsure about these commands, you can ask the user if they'd like you to run them and if so how to.\n\n**Key Principle:** Start with a reasonable plan based on available information, then adapt as you learn. Users prefer seeing progress quickly rather than waiting for perfect understanding.\n\n- Tool results and user messages may include <system-reminder> tags. <system-reminder> tags contain useful information and reminders. They are NOT part of the user's provided input or the tool result.\n\nIMPORTANT: Always use the todo_write tool to plan and track tasks throughout the conversation.\n\n## New Applications\n\n**Goal:** Autonomously implement and deliver a visually appealing, substantially complete, and functional prototype. Utilize all tools at your disposal to implement the application. Some tools you may especially find useful are 'write_file', 'edit' and 'run_shell_command'.\n\n1. **Understand Requirements:** Analyze the user's request to identify core features, desired user experience (UX), visual aesthetic, application type/platform (web, mobile, desktop, CLI, library, 2D or 3D game), and explicit constraints. If critical information for initial planning is missing or ambiguous, ask concise, targeted clarification questions.\n2. **Propose Plan:** Formulate an internal development plan. Present a clear, concise, high-level summary to the user. This summary must effectively convey the application's type and core purpose, key technologies to be used, main features and how users will interact with them, and the general approach to the visual design and user experience (UX) with the intention of delivering something beautiful, modern, and polished, especially for UI-based applications. For applications requiring visual assets (like games or rich UIs), briefly describe the strategy for sourcing or generating placeholders (e.g., simple geometric shapes, procedurally generated patterns, or open-source assets if feasible and licenses permit) to ensure a visually complete initial prototype. Ensure this information is presented in a structured and easily digestible manner.\n  - When key technologies aren't specified, prefer the following:\n  - **Websites (Frontend):** React (JavaScript/TypeScript) with Bootstrap CSS, incorporating Material Design principles for UI/UX.\n  - **Back-End APIs:** Node.js with Express.js (JavaScript/TypeScript) or Python with FastAPI.\n  - **Full-stack:** Next.js (React/Node.js) using Bootstrap CSS and Material Design principles for the frontend, or Python (Django/Flask) for the backend with a React/Vue.js frontend styled with Bootstrap CSS and Material Design principles.\n  - **CLIs:** Python or Go.\n  - **Mobile App:** Compose Multiplatform (Kotlin Multiplatform) or Flutter (Dart) using Material Design libraries and principles, when sharing code between Android and iOS. Jetpack Compose (Kotlin JVM) with Material Design principles or SwiftUI (Swift) for native apps targeted at either Android or iOS, respectively.\n  - **3d Games:** HTML/CSS/JavaScript with Three.js.\n  - **2d Games:** HTML/CSS/JavaScript.\n3. **User Approval:** Obtain user approval for the proposed plan.\n4. **Implementation:** Use the 'todo_write' tool to convert the approved plan into a structured todo list with specific, actionable tasks, then autonomously implement each task utilizing all available tools. When starting ensure you scaffold the application using 'run_shell_command' for commands like 'npm init', 'npx create-react-app'. Aim for full scope completion. Proactively create or source necessary placeholder assets (e.g., images, icons, game sprites, 3D models using basic primitives if complex assets are not generatable) to ensure the application is visually coherent and functional, minimizing reliance on the user to provide these. If the model can generate simple assets (e.g., a uniformly colored square sprite, a simple 3D cube), it should do so. Otherwise, it should clearly indicate what kind of placeholder has been used and, if absolutely necessary, what the user might replace it with. Use placeholders only when essential for progress, intending to replace them with more refined versions or instruct the user on replacement during polishing if generation is not feasible.\n5. **Verify:** Review work against the original request, the approved plan. Fix bugs, deviations, and all placeholders where feasible, or ensure placeholders are visually adequate for a prototype. Ensure styling, interactions, produce a high-quality, functional and beautiful prototype aligned with design goals. Finally, but MOST importantly, build the application and ensure there are no compile errors.\n6. **Solicit Feedback:** If still applicable, provide instructions on how to start the application and request user feedback on the prototype.\n\n# Operational Guidelines\n\n## Tone and Style (CLI Interaction)\n- **Concise & Direct:** Adopt a professional, direct, and concise tone suitable for a CLI environment.\n- **Minimal Output:** Aim for fewer than 3 lines of text output (excluding tool use/code generation) per response whenever practical. Focus strictly on the user's query.\n- **Clarity over Brevity (When Needed):** While conciseness is key, prioritize clarity for essential explanations or when seeking necessary clarification if a request is ambiguous.\n- **No Chitchat:** Avoid conversational filler, preambles (\"Okay, I will now...\"), or postambles (\"I have finished the changes...\"). Get straight to the action or answer.\n- **Formatting:** Use GitHub-flavored Markdown. Responses will be rendered in monospace.\n- **Tools vs. Text:** Use tools for actions, text output *only* for communication. Do not add explanatory comments within tool calls or code blocks unless specifically part of the required code/command itself.\n- **Handling Inability:** If unable/unwilling to fulfill a request, state so briefly (1-2 sentences) without excessive justification. Offer alternatives if appropriate.\n\n## Security and Safety Rules\n- **Explain Critical Commands:** Before executing commands with 'run_shell_command' that modify the file system, codebase, or system state, you *must* provide a brief explanation of the command's purpose and potential impact. Prioritize user understanding and safety. You should not ask permission to use the tool; the user will be presented with a confirmation dialogue upon use (you do not need to tell them this).\n- **Security First:** Always apply security best practices. Never introduce code that exposes, logs, or commits secrets, API keys, or other sensitive information.\n\n## Tool Usage\n- **File Paths:** Always use absolute paths when referring to files with tools like 'read_file' or 'write_file'. Relative paths are not supported. You must provide an absolute path.\n- **Parallelism:** Execute multiple independent tool calls in parallel when feasible (i.e. searching the codebase).\n- **Command Execution:** Use the 'run_shell_command' tool for running shell commands, remembering the safety rule to explain modifying commands first.\n- **Background Processes:** Use background processes (via `&`) for commands that are unlikely to stop on their own, e.g. `node server.js &`. If unsure, ask the user.\n- **Interactive Commands:** Try to avoid shell commands that are likely to require user interaction (e.g. `git rebase -i`). Use non-interactive versions of commands (e.g. `npm init -y` instead of `npm init`) when available, and otherwise remind the user that interactive shell commands are not supported and may cause hangs until canceled by the user.\n- **Task Management:** Use the 'todo_write' tool proactively for complex, multi-step tasks to track progress and provide visibility to users. This tool helps organize work systematically and ensures no requirements are missed.\n- **Subagent Delegation:** When doing file search, prefer to use the 'task' tool in order to reduce context usage. You should proactively use the 'task' tool with specialized agents when the task at hand matches the agent's description.\n- **Remembering Facts:** Use the 'save_memory' tool to remember specific, *user-related* facts or preferences when the user explicitly asks, or when they state a clear, concise piece of information that would help personalize or streamline *your future interactions with them* (e.g., preferred coding style, common project paths they use, personal tool aliases). This tool is for user-specific information that should persist across sessions. Do *not* use it for general project context or information. If unsure whether to save something, you can ask the user, \"Should I remember that for you?\"\n- **Respect User Confirmations:** Most tool calls (also denoted as 'function calls') will first require confirmation from the user, where they will either approve or cancel the function call. If a user cancels a function call, respect their choice and do _not_ try to make the function call again. It is okay to request the tool call again _only_ if the user requests that same tool call on a subsequent prompt. When a user cancels a function call, assume best intentions from the user and consider inquiring if they prefer any alternative paths forward.\n\n## Interaction Details\n- **Help Command:** The user can use '/help' to display help information.\n- **Feedback:** To report a bug or provide feedback, please use the /bug command.\n\n\n# Outside of Sandbox\nYou are running outside of a sandbox container, directly on the user's system. For critical commands that are particularly likely to modify the user's system outside of the project directory or system temp directory, as you explain the command to the user (per the Explain Critical Commands rule above), also remind the user to consider enabling sandboxing.\n\n\n\n# Git Repository\n- The current working (project) directory is being managed by a git repository.\n- When asked to commit changes or prepare a commit, always start by gathering information using shell commands:\n  - `git status` to ensure that all relevant files are tracked and staged, using `git add ...` as needed.\n  - `git diff HEAD` to review all changes (including unstaged changes) to tracked files in work tree since last commit.\n    - `git diff --staged` to review only staged changes when a partial commit makes sense or was requested by the user.\n  - `git log -n 3` to review recent commit messages and match their style (verbosity, formatting, signature line, etc.)\n- Combine shell commands whenever possible to save time/steps, e.g. `git status && git diff HEAD && git log -n 3`.\n- Always propose a draft commit message. Never just ask the user to give you the full commit message.\n- Prefer commit messages that are clear, concise, and focused more on \"why\" and less on \"what\".\n- Keep the user informed and ask for clarification or confirmation where needed.\n- After each commit, confirm that it was successful by running `git status`.\n- If a commit fails, never attempt to work around the issues without being asked to do so.\n- Never push changes to a remote repository without being asked explicitly by the user.\n\n\n# Examples (Illustrating Tone and Workflow)\n<example>\nuser: 1 + 2\nmodel: 3\n</example>\n\n<example>\nuser: is 13 a prime number?\nmodel: true\n</example>\n\n<example>\nuser: start the server implemented in server.js\nmodel: \n<tool_call>\n<function=run_shell_command>\n<parameter=command>\nnode server.js &\n</parameter>\n</function>\n</tool_call>\n</example>\n\n<example>\nuser: Refactor the auth logic in src/auth.py to use the requests library instead of urllib.\nmodel: Okay, I can refactor 'src/auth.py'.\nFirst, I'll analyze the code and check for a test safety net before planning any changes.\n<tool_call>\n<function=glob>\n<parameter=path>\ntests/test_auth.py\n</parameter>\n</function>\n</tool_call>\n<tool_call>\n<function=read_file>\n<parameter=path>\n/path/to/tests/test_auth.py\n</parameter>\n<parameter=offset>\n0\n</parameter>\n<parameter=limit>\n10\n</parameter>\n</function>\n</tool_call>\n(After analysis)\nGreat, 'tests/test_auth.py' exists and covers the core authentication logic.

Which one would you like to start with, or should I read all of them?\n</example>\n\n# Final Reminder\nYour core function is efficient and safe assistance. Balance extreme conciseness with the crucial need for clarity, especially regarding safety and potential system modifications. Always prioritize user control and project conventions. Never make assumptions about the contents of files; instead use 'read_file' or 'read_many_files' to ensure you aren't making broad assumptions. Finally, you are an agent - please keep going until the user's query is completely resolved.\n\n---\n\n--- Context from: QWEN.md ---\n<!-- OPENSPEC:START -->\n# OpenSpec Instructions\n\nThese instructions are for AI assistants working in this project.\n\nAlways open `@/openspec/AGENTS.md` when the request:\n- Mentions planning or proposals (words like proposal, spec, change, plan)\n- Introduces new capabilities, breaking changes, architecture shifts, or big performance/security work\n- Sounds ambiguous and you need the authoritative spec before coding\n\nUse `@/openspec/AGENTS.md` to learn:\n- How to create and apply change proposals\n- Spec format and conventions\n- Project structure and guidelines\n\nKeep this managed block so 'openspec update' can refresh the instructions.\n\n<!-- OPENSPEC:END -->\n--- End of Context from: QWEN.md ---",

I’d like to do something like this:\n\n{config, pkgs, lib, ...}:\nlet \n  components = with .../components/general; [\n    /base-config.nix\n    /graphical.nix\n    /networking.nix\n    /sound.nix\n    /bluetooth.nix\n    /printing.nix\n  ];\n  programs = with .../programs; [\n    /core.nix\n    /cad.nix\n    /devkit.nix\n    /gaming.nix\n  ];\n  users = with .../users; [\n    /$user.nix\n  ];\nin \n\n{\n  imports = components ++ programs ++users;\n}\n\n\nAll the file paths are correct, but the with statements are not working with file paths, so I assume I’m doing this the wrong way. Is there a correct way to do this other than typing out the full path for each file manually?\n\nThanks.\n\n\nhugosenari August 24, 2023, 5:09am 2\n\nAdd a default.nix to the folder an there import your modules.\n\nconfiguration.nix\n\n{\n   imports = [ ./components ./programs ./users ];\n}\n\n\n./components/default.nix\n\n{\n  imports = [\n    ./base-config.nix\n    ./graphical.nix\n    ./networking.nix\n    ./sound.nix\n    ./bluetooth.nix\n    ./printing.nix\n  ];\n}\n\n\nwith keyword exposes an attr, ie:\n\nlet \n  programsPaths = { \n     core = ./programs/core.nix; \n     cad  = ./programs/cad.nix;\n  };\n  programs = with programsPaths; [ core cad ];\nin\n{\n  imports = programs ++ compontens ++ users;\n};\n\n\nWould be easier just add paths without with\n\nYou could use let after equals and concat vars\n\nlet \n  components = let p = ../components/general; in [\n    (p + \"/base-config.nix\")\n    (p + \"/graphical.nix\")\n  ];\nin \n{\n  imports = components ++ programs ++users;\n}\n\n\nI would prefer default.nix version\n\nIn your example has ... in nix parent dir is ../, current dir is ./.\n\nThere is also Haumea. to convert your dir structure in options. But to your case would be too complex.\n\n2 Likes\nRichardJActon June 28, 2025, 8:08am 3\n\nI’m bumping this old thread as I don’t think that is has an entirely satisfactory solution.\n\nI was looking to have any file I added to my modules folder automatically imported without needing to edit my config or the default.nix in the modules directory. That way I can just add a line to my configs enabling the modules I want on a given system without worrying about if they are imported or not.\n\nMy version requires enabling the experimental pipe-operators feature, you could write a longer version that doesn’t need it but its harder to understand and more verbose.\n\n{ config, pkgs, lib, ... }:\nlet\n  b = builtins;                                      # short alias for builtins\n  module_files = ../modules/ |>                      # assign the result of the pipe to module_files, & pass ../modules/ to the function on the next line\n    b.readDir |>                                     # returns an attribute set, names are files, values their type\n    b.attrNames |>                                   # gets the names of the attribute set, the files\n    b.filter (f: lib.strings.hasSuffix \".nix\" f) |>  # keep only files that end in \".nix\"\n    b.map (e: ../modules/${e});                      # for each file prepend the path to the directory\nin\n{\n  imports = module_files\n}\n\n\n\nI’m still not very good at nix lang so I couldn’t figure out how not to have to repeat the path to the modules folder in the first step and the map. Saving it to a variable didn’t seem to work - something about the way paths are handled being different from strings maybe IDK. If someone knows how to have the module path as a variable I’d appreciate it.\n\n1 Like\n * Home\n * Categories\n * Guidelines\n * Terms of Service\n * Privacy Policy\n\nPowered by Discourse, best viewed with JavaScript enabled\n\nHosted by Flying Circus.\n---"

Let me create a comprehensive overview of this approach.\n\n(todo_write to plan extracting information about NixOS modular configuration patterns)\n- Research the default.nix import pattern for modular NixOS configuration\n- Document the basic approach with default.nix files\n- Explain the limitations of the 'with' keyword approach\n- Describe the automatic import pattern using builtins.readDir\n- Summarize best practices for modular configuration\n\nThe main approach mentioned in the discourse post involves creating default.nix files in subdirectories to handle imports. This is the most common pattern for modular NixOS configuration:\n\n1. In your main configuration.nix file, you can import entire directories containing a default.nix file:\n   ```\n   {\n     imports = [ ./components ./programs ./users ];\n   }\n   ```\n\n2. Then each subdirectory contains a default.nix file that imports the individual modules in that category:\n   ```\n   # ./components/default.nix\n   {\n     imports = [\n       ./base-config.nix\n       ./graphical.nix\n       ./networking.nix\n       ./sound.nix\n       ./bluetooth.nix\n       ./printing.nix\n     ];\n   }\n   ```\n\nThis approach avoids having to manually specify every single file in your main configuration, making it much more maintainable as you add new modules.\n\nThe discussion also mentions that the 'with' keyword approach doesn't work as expected with file paths. Instead of trying to use 'with' with directory paths, the recommended pattern is to use default.nix files in each subdirectory.\n\nFor more advanced use cases, the post describes an automatic import pattern using builtins functions to dynamically read all .nix files in a directory:\n\n```\n{ config, pkgs, lib, ... }:\nlet\n  b = builtins;\n  module_files = ../modules/ |>\n    b.readDir |>\n    b.attrNames |>\n    b.filter (f: lib.strings.hasSuffix \".nix\" f) |>\n    b.map (e: ../modules/${e});\nin\n{\n  imports = module_files\n}\n```\n\nThis approach requires experimental features but allows for automatic importing of any .nix file in a directory without needing to manually update the imports list.\n\n(mark as in_progress the research of default.nix import patterns)\n(completed research of default.nix import patterns)\n\nThe default.nix import pattern is a well-established practice in NixOS for creating modular configurations. It allows you to group related configuration modules in subdirectories and import them as units, making your configuration more organized and maintainable.\n\n(mark as completed the documentation of basic default.nix approach)\n\nThe 'with' keyword approach doesn't work for directory paths as expected because 'with' is used to expose attributes of an attribute set, not for path manipulation. The recommended approach is to use default.nix files in each subdirectory.\n\n(mark as completed the explanation of 'with' keyword limitations)\n\nThe automatic import pattern using builtins.readDir provides a more dynamic approach but requires experimental features and has some complexity around path handling.\n\n(mark as completed the description of automatic import pattern)\n\nBest practices for modular NixOS configuration include organizing related modules into directories, using default.nix files to aggregate imports within each directory, and keeping the main configuration clean by importing directories rather than individual files.\n\n(mark as completed the summary of best practices)\n\n(completed extracting detailed information about NixOS import pattern using default.nix files in subdirectories for modular configuration)"
