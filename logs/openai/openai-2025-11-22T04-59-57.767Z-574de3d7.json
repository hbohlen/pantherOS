Your primary goal is to help users safely and efficiently, adhering strictly to the following instructions and utilizing your available tools.\n\n# Core Mandates\n\n- **Conventions:** Rigorously adhere to existing project conventions when reading or modifying code. Analyze surrounding code, tests, and configuration first.\n- **Libraries/Frameworks:** NEVER assume a library/framework is available or appropriate. Verify its established usage within the project (check imports, configuration files like 'package.json', 'Cargo.toml', 'requirements.txt', 'build.gradle', etc., or observe neighboring files) before employing it.\n- **Style & Structure:** Mimic the style (formatting, naming), structure, framework choices, typing, and architectural patterns of existing code in the project.\n- **Idiomatic Changes:** When editing, understand the local context (imports, functions/classes) to ensure your changes integrate naturally and idiomatically.\n- **Comments:** Add code comments sparingly. Focus on *why* something is done, especially for complex logic, rather than *what* is done. Only add high-value comments if necessary for clarity or if requested by the user. Do not edit comments that are separate from the code you are changing. *NEVER* talk to the user or describe your changes through comments.\n- **Proactiveness:** Fulfill the user's request thoroughly. When adding features or fixing bugs, this includes adding tests to ensure quality. Consider all created files, especially tests, to be permanent artifacts unless the user says otherwise.\n- **Confirm Ambiguity/Expansion:** Do not take significant actions beyond the clear scope of the request without confirming with the user. If asked *how* to do something, explain first, don't just do it.\n- **Explaining Changes:** After completing a code modification or file operation *do not* provide summaries unless asked.\n- **Path Construction:** Before using any file system tool (e.g., read_file' or 'write_file'), you must construct the full absolute path for the file_path argument. Always combine the absolute path of the project's root directory with the file's path relative to the root. For example, if the project root is /path/to/project/ and the file is foo/bar/baz.txt, the final path you must use is /path/to/project/foo/bar/baz.txt. If the user provides a relative path, you must resolve it against the root directory to create an absolute path.\n- **Do Not revert changes:** Do not revert changes to the codebase unless asked to do so by the user. Only revert changes made by you if they have resulted in an error or if the user has explicitly asked you to revert the changes.\n\n# Task Management\nYou have access to the todo_write tool to help you manage and plan tasks. Use these tools VERY frequently to ensure that you are tracking your tasks and giving the user visibility into your progress.\nThese tools are also EXTREMELY helpful for planning tasks, and for breaking down larger complex tasks into smaller steps. If you do not use this tool when planning, you may forget to do important tasks - and that is unacceptable.\n\nIt is critical that you mark todos as completed as soon as you are done with a task. Do not batch up multiple tasks before marking them as completed.\n\nExamples:\n\n<example>\nuser: Run the build and fix any type errors\nassistant: I'm going to use the todo_write tool to write the following items to the todo list: \n- Run the build\n- Fix any type errors\n\nI'm now going to run the build using Bash.\n\nLooks like I found 10 type errors. I'm going to use the todo_write tool to write 10 items to the todo list.\n\nmarking the first todo as in_progress\n\nLet me start working on the first item...\n\nThe first item has been fixed, let me mark the first todo as completed, and move on to the second item...\n..\n..\n</example>\nIn the above example, the assistant completes all the tasks, including the 10 error fixes and running the build and fixing all errors.\n\n<example>\nuser: Help me write a new feature that allows users to track their usage metrics and export them to various formats\n\nA: I'll help you implement a usage metrics tracking and export feature. Let me first use the todo_write tool to plan this task.\nAdding the following todos to the todo list:\n1. Research existing metrics tracking in the codebase\n2. Design the metrics collection system\n3. Implement core metrics tracking functionality\n4. Create export functionality for different formats\n\nLet me start by researching the existing codebase to understand what metrics we might already be tracking and how we can build on that.\n\nI'm going to search for any existing metrics or telemetry code in the project.\n\nI've found some existing telemetry code. Let me mark the first todo as in_progress and start designing our metrics tracking system based on what I've learned...\n\n[Assistant continues implementing the feature step by step, marking todos as in_progress and completed as they go]\n</example>\n\n\n# Primary Workflows\n\n## Software Engineering Tasks\nWhen requested to perform tasks like fixing bugs, adding features, refactoring, or explaining code, follow this iterative approach:\n- **Plan:** After understanding the user's request, create an initial plan based on your existing knowledge and any immediately obvious context. Use the 'todo_write' tool to capture this rough plan for complex or multi-step work. Don't wait for complete understanding - start with what you know.\n- **Implement:** Begin implementing the plan while gathering additional context as needed. Use 'grep_search', 'glob', 'read_file', and 'read_many_files' tools strategically when you encounter specific unknowns during implementation. Use the available tools (e.g., 'edit', 'write_file' 'run_shell_command' ...) to act on the plan, strictly adhering to the project's established conventions (detailed under 'Core Mandates').\n- **Adapt:** As you discover new information or encounter obstacles, update your plan and todos accordingly. Mark todos as in_progress when starting and completed when finishing each task. Add new todos if the scope expands. Refine your approach based on what you learn.\n- **Verify (Tests):** If applicable and feasible, verify the changes using the project's testing procedures. Identify the correct test commands and frameworks by examining 'README' files, build/package configuration (e.g., 'package.json'), or existing test execution patterns. NEVER assume standard test commands.\n- **Verify (Standards):** VERY IMPORTANT: After making code changes, execute the project-specific build, linting and type-checking commands (e.g., 'tsc', 'npm run lint', 'ruff check .') that you have identified for this project (or obtained from the user). This ensures code quality and adherence to standards. If unsure about these commands, you can ask the user if they'd like you to run them and if so how to.\n\n**Key Principle:** Start with a reasonable plan based on available information, then adapt as you learn. Users prefer seeing progress quickly rather than waiting for perfect understanding.\n\n- Tool results and user messages may include <system-reminder> tags. <system-reminder> tags contain useful information and reminders. They are NOT part of the user's provided input or the tool result.\n\nIMPORTANT: Always use the todo_write tool to plan and track tasks throughout the conversation.\n\n## New Applications\n\n**Goal:** Autonomously implement and deliver a visually appealing, substantially complete, and functional prototype. Utilize all tools at your disposal to implement the application. Some tools you may especially find useful are 'write_file', 'edit' and 'run_shell_command'.\n\n1. **Understand Requirements:** Analyze the user's request to identify core features, desired user experience (UX), visual aesthetic, application type/platform (web, mobile, desktop, CLI, library, 2D or 3D game), and explicit constraints. If critical information for initial planning is missing or ambiguous, ask concise, targeted clarification questions.\n2. **Propose Plan:** Formulate an internal development plan. Present a clear, concise, high-level summary to the user. This summary must effectively convey the application's type and core purpose, key technologies to be used, main features and how users will interact with them, and the general approach to the visual design and user experience (UX) with the intention of delivering something beautiful, modern, and polished, especially for UI-based applications. For applications requiring visual assets (like games or rich UIs), briefly describe the strategy for sourcing or generating placeholders (e.g., simple geometric shapes, procedurally generated patterns, or open-source assets if feasible and licenses permit) to ensure a visually complete initial prototype. Ensure this information is presented in a structured and easily digestible manner.\n  - When key technologies aren't specified, prefer the following:\n  - **Websites (Frontend):** React (JavaScript/TypeScript) with Bootstrap CSS, incorporating Material Design principles for UI/UX.\n  - **Back-End APIs:** Node.js with Express.js (JavaScript/TypeScript) or Python with FastAPI.\n  - **Full-stack:** Next.js (React/Node.js) using Bootstrap CSS and Material Design principles for the frontend, or Python (Django/Flask) for the backend with a React/Vue.js frontend styled with Bootstrap CSS and Material Design principles.\n  - **CLIs:** Python or Go.\n  - **Mobile App:** Compose Multiplatform (Kotlin Multiplatform) or Flutter (Dart) using Material Design libraries and principles, when sharing code between Android and iOS. Jetpack Compose (Kotlin JVM) with Material Design principles or SwiftUI (Swift) for native apps targeted at either Android or iOS, respectively.\n  - **3d Games:** HTML/CSS/JavaScript with Three.js.\n  - **2d Games:** HTML/CSS/JavaScript.\n3. **User Approval:** Obtain user approval for the proposed plan.\n4. **Implementation:** Use the 'todo_write' tool to convert the approved plan into a structured todo list with specific, actionable tasks, then autonomously implement each task utilizing all available tools. When starting ensure you scaffold the application using 'run_shell_command' for commands like 'npm init', 'npx create-react-app'. Aim for full scope completion. Proactively create or source necessary placeholder assets (e.g., images, icons, game sprites, 3D models using basic primitives if complex assets are not generatable) to ensure the application is visually coherent and functional, minimizing reliance on the user to provide these. If the model can generate simple assets (e.g., a uniformly colored square sprite, a simple 3D cube), it should do so. Otherwise, it should clearly indicate what kind of placeholder has been used and, if absolutely necessary, what the user might replace it with. Use placeholders only when essential for progress, intending to replace them with more refined versions or instruct the user on replacement during polishing if generation is not feasible.\n5. **Verify:** Review work against the original request, the approved plan. Fix bugs, deviations, and all placeholders where feasible, or ensure placeholders are visually adequate for a prototype. Ensure styling, interactions, produce a high-quality, functional and beautiful prototype aligned with design goals. Finally, but MOST importantly, build the application and ensure there are no compile errors.\n6. **Solicit Feedback:** If still applicable, provide instructions on how to start the application and request user feedback on the prototype.\n\n# Operational Guidelines\n\n## Tone and Style (CLI Interaction)\n- **Concise & Direct:** Adopt a professional, direct, and concise tone suitable for a CLI environment.\n- **Minimal Output:** Aim for fewer than 3 lines of text output (excluding tool use/code generation) per response whenever practical. Focus strictly on the user's query.\n- **Clarity over Brevity (When Needed):** While conciseness is key, prioritize clarity for essential explanations or when seeking necessary clarification if a request is ambiguous.\n- **No Chitchat:** Avoid conversational filler, preambles (\"Okay, I will now...\"), or postambles (\"I have finished the changes...\"). Get straight to the action or answer.\n- **Formatting:** Use GitHub-flavored Markdown. Responses will be rendered in monospace.\n- **Tools vs. Text:** Use tools for actions, text output *only* for communication. Do not add explanatory comments within tool calls or code blocks unless specifically part of the required code/command itself.\n- **Handling Inability:** If unable/unwilling to fulfill a request, state so briefly (1-2 sentences) without excessive justification. Offer alternatives if appropriate.\n\n## Security and Safety Rules\n- **Explain Critical Commands:** Before executing commands with 'run_shell_command' that modify the file system, codebase, or system state, you *must* provide a brief explanation of the command's purpose and potential impact. Prioritize user understanding and safety. You should not ask permission to use the tool; the user will be presented with a confirmation dialogue upon use (you do not need to tell them this).\n- **Security First:** Always apply security best practices. Never introduce code that exposes, logs, or commits secrets, API keys, or other sensitive information.\n\n## Tool Usage\n- **File Paths:** Always use absolute paths when referring to files with tools like 'read_file' or 'write_file'. Relative paths are not supported. You must provide an absolute path.\n- **Parallelism:** Execute multiple independent tool calls in parallel when feasible (i.e. searching the codebase).\n- **Command Execution:** Use the 'run_shell_command' tool for running shell commands, remembering the safety rule to explain modifying commands first.\n- **Background Processes:** Use background processes (via `&`) for commands that are unlikely to stop on their own, e.g. `node server.js &`. If unsure, ask the user.\n- **Interactive Commands:** Try to avoid shell commands that are likely to require user interaction (e.g. `git rebase -i`). Use non-interactive versions of commands (e.g. `npm init -y` instead of `npm init`) when available, and otherwise remind the user that interactive shell commands are not supported and may cause hangs until canceled by the user.\n- **Task Management:** Use the 'todo_write' tool proactively for complex, multi-step tasks to track progress and provide visibility to users. This tool helps organize work systematically and ensures no requirements are missed.\n- **Subagent Delegation:** When doing file search, prefer to use the 'task' tool in order to reduce context usage. You should proactively use the 'task' tool with specialized agents when the task at hand matches the agent's description.\n- **Remembering Facts:** Use the 'save_memory' tool to remember specific, *user-related* facts or preferences when the user explicitly asks, or when they state a clear, concise piece of information that would help personalize or streamline *your future interactions with them* (e.g., preferred coding style, common project paths they use, personal tool aliases). This tool is for user-specific information that should persist across sessions. Do *not* use it for general project context or information. If unsure whether to save something, you can ask the user, \"Should I remember that for you?\"\n- **Respect User Confirmations:** Most tool calls (also denoted as 'function calls') will first require confirmation from the user, where they will either approve or cancel the function call. If a user cancels a function call, respect their choice and do _not_ try to make the function call again. It is okay to request the tool call again _only_ if the user requests that same tool call on a subsequent prompt. When a user cancels a function call, assume best intentions from the user and consider inquiring if they prefer any alternative paths forward.\n\n## Interaction Details\n- **Help Command:** The user can use '/help' to display help information.\n- **Feedback:** To report a bug or provide feedback, please use the /bug command.\n\n\n# Outside of Sandbox\nYou are running outside of a sandbox container, directly on the user's system. For critical commands that are particularly likely to modify the user's system outside of the project directory or system temp directory, as you explain the command to the user (per the Explain Critical Commands rule above), also remind the user to consider enabling sandboxing.\n\n\n\n# Git Repository\n- The current working (project) directory is being managed by a git repository.\n- When asked to commit changes or prepare a commit, always start by gathering information using shell commands:\n  - `git status` to ensure that all relevant files are tracked and staged, using `git add ...` as needed.\n  - `git diff HEAD` to review all changes (including unstaged changes) to tracked files in work tree since last commit.\n    - `git diff --staged` to review only staged changes when a partial commit makes sense or was requested by the user.\n  - `git log -n 3` to review recent commit messages and match their style (verbosity, formatting, signature line, etc.)\n- Combine shell commands whenever possible to save time/steps, e.g. `git status && git diff HEAD && git log -n 3`.\n- Always propose a draft commit message. Never just ask the user to give you the full commit message.\n- Prefer commit messages that are clear, concise, and focused more on \"why\" and less on \"what\".\n- Keep the user informed and ask for clarification or confirmation where needed.\n- After each commit, confirm that it was successful by running `git status`.\n- If a commit fails, never attempt to work around the issues without being asked to do so.\n- Never push changes to a remote repository without being asked explicitly by the user.\n\n\n# Examples (Illustrating Tone and Workflow)\n<example>\nuser: 1 + 2\nmodel: 3\n</example>\n\n<example>\nuser: is 13 a prime number?\nmodel: true\n</example>\n\n<example>\nuser: start the server implemented in server.js\nmodel: \n<tool_call>\n<function=run_shell_command>\n<parameter=command>\nnode server.js &\n</parameter>\n</function>\n</tool_call>\n</example>\n\n<example>\nuser: Refactor the auth logic in src/auth.py to use the requests library instead of urllib.\nmodel: Okay, I can refactor 'src/auth.py'.\nFirst, I'll analyze the code and check for a test safety net before planning any changes.\n<tool_call>\n<function=glob>\n<parameter=path>\ntests/test_auth.py\n</parameter>\n</function>\n</tool_call>\n<tool_call>\n<function=read_file>\n<parameter=path>\n/path/to/tests/test_auth.py\n</parameter>\n<parameter=offset>\n0\n</parameter>\n<parameter=limit>\n10\n</parameter>\n</function>\n</tool_call>\n(After analysis)\nGreat, 'tests/test_auth.py' exists and covers the core authentication logic.

This is a stable checkpoint.\n</example>\n\n<example>\nuser: Where are all the 'app.config' files in this project? I need to check their settings.\nmodel:\n<tool_call>\n<function=glob>\n<parameter=pattern>\n./**/app.config\n</parameter>\n</function>\n</tool_call>\n(Assuming GlobTool returns a list of paths like ['/path/to/moduleA/app.config', '/path/to/moduleB/app.config'])\nI found the following 'app.config' files:\n- /path/to/moduleA/app.config\n- /path/to/moduleB/app.config\nTo help you check their settings, I can read their contents. Which one would you like to start with, or should I read all of them?\n</example>\n\n# Final Reminder\nYour core function is efficient and safe assistance. Balance extreme conciseness with the crucial need for clarity, especially regarding safety and potential system modifications. Always prioritize user control and project conventions. Never make assumptions about the contents of files; instead use 'read_file' or 'read_many_files' to ensure you aren't making broad assumptions. Finally, you are an agent - please keep going until the user's query is completely resolved.\n\n---\n\n--- Context from: QWEN.md ---\n<!-- OPENSPEC:START -->\n# OpenSpec Instructions\n\nThese instructions are for AI assistants working in this project.\n\nAlways open `@/openspec/AGENTS.md` when the request:\n- Mentions planning or proposals (words like proposal, spec, change, plan)\n- Introduces new capabilities, breaking changes, architecture shifts, or big performance/security work\n- Sounds ambiguous and you need the authoritative spec before coding\n\nUse `@/openspec/AGENTS.md` to learn:\n- How to create and apply change proposals\n- Spec format and conventions\n- Project structure and guidelines\n\nKeep this managed block so 'openspec update' can refresh the instructions.\n\n<!-- OPENSPEC:END -->\n--- End of Context from: QWEN.md ---",

The current configuration structure in /etc/nixos should be as follows:\n\n$ tree\n.\n├── flake.lock\n├── flake.nix\n├── home.nix\n└── configuration.nix\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n\n\nThe functions of these four files are:\n\n * flake.lock: An automatically generated version-lock file that records all input sources, hash values, and version numbers of the entire flake to ensure reproducibility.\n * flake.nix: The entry file that will be recognized and deployed when executing sudo nixos-rebuild switch. See Flakes - NixOS Wiki for all options of flake.nix.\n * configuration.nix: Imported as a Nix module in flake.nix, all system-level configuration is currently written here. See Configuration - NixOS Manual for all options of configuration.nix.\n * home.nix: Imported by Home-Manager as the configuration of the user ryan in flake.nix, containing all of ryan's configuration and managing ryan's home folder. See Appendix A. Configuration Options - Home-Manager for all options of home.nix.\n\nBy modifying these files, you can declaratively change the system and home directory status.\n\nHowever, as the configuration grows, relying solely on configuration.nix and home.nix can lead to bloated and difficult-to-maintain files. A better solution is to use the Nix module system to split the configuration into multiple Nix modules and write them in a classified manner.\n\nThe Nix language provides an import function with a special rule:\n\n> If the parameter of import is a folder path, it will return the execution result of the default.nix file in that folder.\n\nThe Nixpkgs module system provides a similar parameter, imports, which accepts a list of .nix files and merge all the configuration defined in these files into the current Nix module.\n\nNote that imports will not simply overwrite duplicate configuration but handle it more reasonably. For example, if program.packages = [...] is defined in multiple modules, then imports will merge all program.packages defined in all Nix modules into one list. Attribute sets can also be merged correctly. The specific behavior can be explored by yourself.\n\n> I only found a description of imports in Nixpkgs-Unstable Official Manual - evalModules Parameters: A list of modules. These are merged together to form the final configuration. It's a bit ambiguous...\n\nWith the help of imports, we can split home.nix and configuration.nix into multiple Nix modules defined in different .nix files. Lets look at an example module packages.nix:\n\nnix\n\n{\n  config,\n  pkgs,\n  ...\n}: {\n  imports = [\n    (import ./special-fonts-1.nix {inherit config pkgs;}) # (1)\n    ./special-fonts-2.nix # (2)\n  ];\n\n  fontconfig.enable = true;\n}\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n\n\nThis module loads two other modules in the imports section, namely special-fonts-1.nix and special-fonts-2.nix. Both files are modules themselves and look similar to this.\n\nnix\n\n{ config, pkgs, ...}: {\n  # Configuration stuff ...\n}\n\n1\n2\n3\n\n\nBoth import statements above are equivalent in the parameters they receive:\n\n * Statement (1) imports the function in special-fonts-1.nix and calls it by passing {config = config; pkgs = pkgs}. Basically using the return value of the call (another partial configuration attribute set) inside the imports list.\n\n * Statement (2) defines a path to a module, whose function Nix will load automatically when assembling the configuration config. It will pass all matching arguments from the function in packages.nix to the loaded function in special-fonts-2.nix which results in import ./special-fonts-2.nix {config = config; pkgs = pkgs}.\n\nHere is a nice starter example of modularizing the configuration, Highly recommended:\n\n * Misterio77/nix-starter-configs\n\nA more complicated example, ryan4yin/nix-config/i3-kickstarter is the configuration of my previous NixOS system with the i3 window manager. Its structure is as follows:\n\nshell\n\n├── flake.lock\n├── flake.nix\n├── home\n│   ├── default.nix         # here we import all submodules by imports = [...]\n│   ├── fcitx5              # fcitx5 input method's configuration\n│   │   ├── default.nix\n│   │   └── rime-data-flypy\n│   ├── i3                  # i3 window manager's configuration\n│   │   ├── config\n│   │   ├── default.nix\n│   │   ├── i3blocks.conf\n│   │   ├── keybindings\n│   │   └── scripts\n│   ├── programs\n│   │   ├── browsers.nix\n│   │   ├── common.nix\n│   │   ├── default.nix   # here we import all modules in programs folder by imports = [...]\n│   │   ├── git.nix\n│   │   ├── media.nix\n│   │   ├── vscode.nix\n│   │   └── xdg.nix\n│   ├── rofi              #  rofi launcher's configuration\n│   │   ├── configs\n│   │   │   ├── arc_dark_colors.rasi\n│   │   │   ├── arc_dark_transparent_colors.rasi\n│   │   │   ├── power-profiles.rasi\n│   │   │   ├── powermenu.rasi\n│   │   │   ├── rofidmenu.rasi\n│   │   │   └── rofikeyhint.rasi\n│   │   └── default.nix\n│   └── shell             # shell/terminal related configuration\n│       ├── common.nix\n│       ├── default.nix\n│       ├── nushell\n│       │   ├── config.nu\n│       │   ├── default.nix\n│       │   └── env.nu\n│       ├── starship.nix\n│       └── terminals.nix\n├── hosts\n│   ├── msi-rtx4090      # My main machine's configuration\n│   │   ├── default.nix  # This is the old configuration.nix, but most of the content has been split out to modules.\n│   │   └── hardware-configuration.nix  # hardware & disk related configuration, autogenerated by nixos\n│   └── my-nixos       # my test machine's configuration\n│       ├── default.nix\n│       └── hardware-configuration.nix\n├── modules          # some common NixOS modules that can be reused\n│   ├── i3.nix\n│   └── system.nix\n└── wallpaper.jpg    # wallpaper\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\n29\n30\n31\n32\n33\n34\n35\n36\n37\n38\n39\n40\n41\n42\n43\n44\n45\n46\n47\n48\n49\n50\n\n\nThere is no need to follow the above structure, you can organize your configuration in any way you like. The key is to use imports to import all the submodules into the main module.\n\n\nLIB.MKOVERRIDE, LIB.MKDEFAULT, AND LIB.MKFORCE\n\nIn Nix, some people use lib.mkDefault and lib.mkForce to define values. These functions are designed to set default values or force values of options.\n\nYou can explore the source code of lib.mkDefault and lib.mkForce by running nix repl -f '<nixpkgs>' and then entering :e lib.mkDefault. To learn more about nix repl, type :? for the help information.\n\nHere's the source code:\n\nnix\n\n  # ......\n\n  mkOverride = priority: content:\n    { _type = \"override\";\n      inherit priority content;\n    };\n\n  mkOptionDefault = mkOverride 1500; # priority of option defaults\n  mkDefault = mkOverride 1000; # used in config sections of non-user modules to set a default\n  mkImageMediaOverride = mkOverride 60; # image media profiles can be derived by inclusion into host config, hence needing to override host config, but do allow user to mkForce\n  mkForce = mkOverride 50;\n  mkVMOverride = mkOverride 10; # used by ‘nixos-rebuild build-vm’\n\n  # ......\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n\n\nIn summary, lib.mkDefault is used to set default values of options with a priority of 1000 internally, and lib.mkForce is used to force values of options with a priority of 50 internally. If you set a value of an option directly, it will be set with a default priority of 1000, the same as lib.mkDefault.\n\nThe lower the priority value, the higher the actual priority. As a result, lib.mkForce has a higher priority than lib.mkDefault. If you define multiple values with the same priority, Nix will throw an error.\n\nUsing these functions can be very helpful for modularizing the configuration. You can set default values in a low-level module (base module) and force values in a high-level module.\n\nFor example, in my configuration at ryan4yin/nix-config/blob/c515ea9/modules/nixos/core-server.nix, I define default values like this:\n\nnix\n\n{ lib, pkgs, ... }:\n\n{\n  # ......\n\n  nixpkgs.config.allowUnfree = lib.mkDefault false;\n\n  # ......\n}\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n\n\nThen, for my desktop machine, I override the value in ryan4yin/nix-config/blob/c515ea9/modules/nixos/core-desktop.nix like this:\n\nnix\n\n{ lib, pkgs, ... }:\n\n{\n  # import the base module\n  imports = [\n    ./core-server.nix\n  ];\n\n  # override the default value defined in the base module\n  nixpkgs.config.allowUnfree = lib.mkForce true;\n\n  # ......\n}\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n\n\n\nLIB.MKORDER, LIB.MKBEFORE, AND LIB.MKAFTER\n\nIn addition to lib.mkDefault and lib.mkForce, there are also lib.mkBefore and lib.mkAfter, which are used to set the merge order of list-type options. These functions further contribute to the modularization of the configuration.\n\n> I haven't found the official documentation for list-type options, but I simply understand that they are types whose merge results are related to the order of merging. According to this understanding, both list and string types are list-type options, and these functions can indeed be used on these two types in practice.\n\nAs mentioned earlier, when you define multiple values with the same override priority, Nix will throw an error. However, by using lib.mkOrder, lib.mkBefore, or lib.mkAfter, you can define multiple values with the same override priority, and they will be merged in the order you specify.\n\nTo examine the source code of lib.mkBefore, you can run nix repl -f '<nixpkgs>' and then enter :e lib.mkBefore. To learn more about nix repl, type :? for the help information:\n\nnix\n\n  # ......\n\n  mkOrder = priority: content:\n    { _type = \"order\";\n      inherit priority content;\n    };\n\n  mkBefore = mkOrder 500;\n  defaultOrderPriority = 1000;\n  mkAfter = mkOrder 1500;\n\n  # ......\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n\n\nTherefore, lib.mkBefore is a shorthand for lib.mkOrder 500, and lib.mkAfter is a shorthand for lib.mkOrder 1500.\n\nTo test the usage of lib.mkBefore and lib.mkAfter, let's create a simple Flake project:\n\nnix\n\n# flake.nix\n{\n  inputs.nixpkgs.url = \"github:NixOS/nixpkgs/nixos-25.05\";\n  outputs = {nixpkgs, ...}: {\n    nixosConfigurations = {\n      \"my-nixos\" = nixpkgs.lib.nixosSystem {\n        modules = [\n          ({lib, ...}: {\n            programs.bash.shellInit = lib.mkBefore ''\n              echo 'insert before default'\n            '';\n            programs.zsh.shellInit = lib.mkBefore \"echo 'insert before default';\";\n            nix.settings.substituters = lib.mkBefore [\n              \"https://nix-community.cachix.org\"\n            ];\n          })\n\n          ({lib, ...}: {\n            programs.bash.shellInit = lib.mkAfter ''\n              echo 'insert after default'\n            '';\n            programs.zsh.shellInit = lib.mkAfter \"echo 'insert after default';\";\n            nix.settings.substituters = lib.mkAfter [\n              \"https://ryan4yin.cachix.org\"\n            ];\n          })\n\n          ({lib, ...}: {\n            programs.bash.shellInit = ''\n              echo 'this is default'\n            '';\n            programs.zsh.shellInit = \"echo 'this is default';\";\n            nix.settings.substituters = [\n              \"https://nix-community.cachix.org\"\n            ];\n          })\n        ];\n      };\n    };\n  };\n}\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\n29\n30\n31\n32\n33\n34\n35\n36\n37\n38\n39\n40\n41\n\n\nThe flake above contains the usage of lib.mkBefore and lib.mkAfter on multiline strings, single-line strings, and lists. Let's test the results:\n\nbash\n\n# Example 1: multiline string merging\n› echo $(nix eval .#nixosConfigurations.my-nixos.config.programs.bash.shellInit)\ntrace: warning: system.stateVersion is not set, defaulting to 25.05. Read why this matters on https://nixos.org/manual/nixos/stable/options.html#opt-system.stateVersio\nn.\n\"echo 'insert before default'\n\necho 'this is default'\n\nif [ -z \\\"$__NIXOS_SET_ENVIRONMENT_DONE\\\" ]; then\n . /nix/store/60882lm9znqdmbssxqsd5bgnb7gybaf2-set-environment\nfi\n\n\n\necho 'insert after default'\n\"\n\n# example 2: single-line string merging\n› echo $(nix eval .#nixosConfigurations.my-nixos.config.programs.zsh.shellInit)\n\"echo 'insert before default';\necho 'this is default';\necho 'insert after default';\"\n\n# Example 3: list merging\n› nix eval .#nixosConfigurations.my-nixos.config.nix.settings.substituters\n[ \"https://nix-community.cachix.org\" \"https://nix-community.cachix.org\" \"https://cache.nixos.org/\" \"https://ryan4yin.cachix.org\" ]\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n\n\nAs you can see, lib.mkBefore and lib.mkAfter can define the order of merging of multiline strings, single-line strings, and lists. The order of merging is the same as the order of definition.\n\n> For a deeper introduction to the module system, see Module System & Custom Options.\n\n\nREFERENCES\n\n * Nix modules: Improving Nix's discoverability and usability\n * Module System - Nixpkgs\n\nEdit this page\n\nLast updated:\n\nPager\nPrevious pageGetting Started with Home Manager\nNext pageUpdating the System\n\nLicensed under CC BY-SA 4.0\n\nCopyright © 2023-present Ryan Yin\n---"

          "content": "Based on the content from the NixOS & Flakes Book, here are the NixOS module system best practices focusing on modular structure, single purpose files, and using default.nix for subdirectories:\n\n## Modular Structure Best Practices\n\n### 1. Split Configuration into Multiple Modules\nInstead of relying solely on `configuration.nix` and `home.nix`, split your configuration into multiple Nix modules organized in a classified manner. This prevents bloated and difficult-to-maintain files as your configuration grows.\n\n### 2. Directory Structure Example\nA well-organized structure might look like:\n```\n├── flake.nix\n├── home/\n│   ├── default.nix         # imports all submodules via imports = [...]\n│   ├── programs/\n│   │   ├── browsers.nix\n│   │   ├── git.nix\n│   │   ├── default.nix     # imports all modules in programs folder\n│   └── shell/\n│       ├── common.nix\n│       └── default.nix\n├── hosts/\n│   ├── msi-rtx4090/\n│   │   ├── default.nix     # old configuration.nix, content split out\n│   │   └── hardware-configuration.nix\n└── modules/                # reusable NixOS modules\n    ├── i3.nix\n    └── system.nix\n```\n\n## Single Purpose Files\n\n### 1. Organize by Functionality\nEach file should have a single purpose or focus on a specific functionality. For example:\n- `browsers.nix` for browser configuration\n- `git.nix` for Git settings\n- `i3.nix` for i3 window manager configuration\n\n### 2. Use the imports Parameter\nThe `imports` parameter accepts a list of `.nix` files and merges all configurations defined in these files into the current Nix module. This allows you to combine single-purpose files into a cohesive configuration.\n\nExample module:\n```nix\n{\n  config,\n  pkgs,\n  ...\n}: {\n  imports = [\n    (import ./special-fonts-1.nix {inherit config pkgs;})\n    ./special-fonts-2.nix\n  ];\n\n  fontconfig.enable = true;\n}\n```\n\n## Using default.nix for Subdirectories\n\n### 1. Special Import Rule\nThe Nix language has a special rule: if the parameter of `import` is a folder path, it will return the execution result of the `default.nix` file in that folder.\n\n### 2. Centralized Imports\nUse `default.nix` files in subdirectories to import all modules within that directory:\n\nIn `home/default.nix`:\n```nix\n{ lib, ... }: {\n  imports = [\n    ./programs\n    ./shell\n    ./fcitx5\n    ./rofi\n    ./i3\n  ];\n}\n```\n\nIn `programs/default.nix`:\n```nix\n{ lib, ... }: {\n  imports = [\n    ./browsers.nix\n    ./git.nix\n    ./media.nix\n    ./vscode.nix\n    ./xdg.nix\n  ];\n}\n```\n\n### 3. Module Loading Equivalence\nBoth of these import statements are equivalent in parameters received:\n- `(import ./special-fonts-1.nix {inherit config pkgs;})` - explicitly imports and calls the function\n- `./special-fonts-2.nix` - Nix automatically loads the function when assembling the configuration\n\n## Additional Best Practices\n\n### 1. Priority Handling with lib.mkDefault and lib.mkForce\n- `lib.mkDefault` sets default values with priority 1000\n- `lib.mkForce` forces values with priority 50 (higher actual priority)\n- Lower priority values have higher actual priority\n- Use these for hierarchical configuration (base modules with defaults, specialized modules with forced values)\n\n### 2. Order Control with lib.mkBefore and lib.mkAfter\n- `lib.mkBefore` sets content with priority 500 (appears before default content)\n- `lib.mkAfter` sets content with priority 1500 (appears after default content)\n- Useful for controlling the merge order of list-type options (lists, strings, etc.)\n\nBy following these practices, you can maintain a clean, modular, and maintainable NixOS configuration that scales well with complexity."
