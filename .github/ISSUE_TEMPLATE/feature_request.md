## Next Steps

Once this issue is approved:

1. [ ] Create specification using `/speckit.specify`
2. [ ] Clarify requirements using `/speckit.clarify`
3. [ ] Create technical plan using `/speckit.plan`
4. [ ] Break down into tasks using `/speckit.tasks`
5. [ ] Begin implementation

**Note:** Feature requests without specifications will be labeled `needs-spec` and won't proceed to implementation until a spec is created.
