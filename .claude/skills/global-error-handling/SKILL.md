# Global Error Handling

## When to use this skill:

- Writing try-catch blocks around error-prone code
- Creating custom error classes and exception types
- Implementing global error handlers (process.on('uncaughtException'), etc.)
- Handling async/await errors with proper patterns
- Logging errors with appropriate levels (error, warn, info, debug)
- Creating user-friendly error messages for APIs and UIs
- Implementing retry mechanisms and circuit breakers
- Handling network errors, timeouts, and connection issues
- Managing validation errors and form error states
- Setting up error monitoring and tracking (Sentry, etc.)
- Implementing proper error propagation up the call stack

This Skill provides Claude Code with specific guidance on how to adhere to coding standards as they relate to how it should handle global error handling.
