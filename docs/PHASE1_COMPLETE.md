# Phase 1: Hardware Discovery - COMPLETE ✅

**Date Completed:** 2025-11-21
**Project:** pantherOS

## Summary

Phase 1 (Hardware Discovery & Documentation) has been successfully completed. All critical hardware information has been gathered, documented, and analyzed for the pantherOS NixOS configuration project.

## Completed Tasks

### ✅ 1. Hardware Discovery
Successfully gathered complete hardware specifications for all 4 hosts:

| Host | Type | CPU | RAM | Storage | Status |
|------|------|-----|-----|---------|--------|
| **yoga** | Laptop | AMD Ryzen AI 7 350 (16c) | 14GB | 1x NVMe 1TB (Btrfs) | ✓ Complete |
| **zephyrus** | Laptop | Intel i9-12900H (20c) | 38GB | 2x NVMe 2.7TB (Btrfs) | ✓ Complete |
| **hetzner-vps** | Server | AMD EPYC Genoa (12c) | 24GB | 1x SSD 440GB (ext4) | ✓ Complete |
| **ovh-vps** | Server | Intel Haswell (8c) | 22GB | 1x SSD 195GB (ext4) | ✓ Complete |

### ✅ 2. Documentation Updates
Updated `pantherOS.md` with:
- Complete CPU, GPU, RAM, and disk specifications for all hosts
- Wireless and battery information for laptops
- Virtualization details for servers
- Current filesystem status (Btrfs vs ext4)

### ✅ 3. Disk Layout Planning
Created comprehensive Btrfs sub-volume layout plan:
- **File:** `docs/plans/btrfs-subvolume-layouts.md`
- Host-specific layouts based on purpose and hardware
- SSD optimization strategies
- Podman container storage considerations
- Migration plans for VPS hosts (ext4 → Btrfs)

### ✅ 4. Terminal Research
Investigated Ghostty terminal emulator:
- **File:** `docs/plans/ghostty-research.md`
- Documented availability status (requires verification)
- Identified alternative terminals (WezTerm, Kitty, Alacritty)
- Created testing and verification plan

### ✅ 5. Configuration Review
Analyzed existing host configurations:
- **File:** `docs/plans/host-configurations-review.md`
- Documented current state of all config files
- Identified gaps and inconsistencies
- Prioritized implementation plan for Phase 3

## Key Findings

### Filesystem Status
- **yoga & zephyrus:** Already using Btrfs ✓
- **hetzner-vps & ovh-vps:** Currently ext4, need migration

### Configuration Status
- **hetzner-vps:** 85% complete (has detailed config, needs hardware.nix update)
- **yoga, zephyrus, ovh-vps:** 0% complete (empty config files)

### Notable Observations
- zephyrus already has Tailscale installed and running
- All workstations already use Btrfs (easier migration)
- VPS servers need Btrfs migration but have simpler configs

## Next Phase: Module Development

**Next Steps:**
1. Add missing flake inputs (niri-flake, dankmaterialshell)
2. Create modular system and home-manager configurations
3. Begin with completing hetzner-vps (simplest headless server)

## Files Created/Modified

### Modified
- `pantherOS.md` - Hardware specifications added

### Created
- `docs/plans/btrfs-subvolume-layouts.md` - Btrfs strategy
- `docs/plans/ghostty-research.md` - Terminal investigation
- `docs/plans/host-configurations-review.md` - Config analysis
- `docs/PHASE1_COMPLETE.md` - This summary

## Impact on Project

Phase 1 completion enables:
- ✅ Proper hardware-specific optimizations
- ✅ Accurate disk layout planning
- ✅ Informed module design decisions
- ✅ Prioritized implementation roadmap
- ✅ Knowledge base for future development

**Phase 1 Status: COMPLETE** ✅
**Ready for Phase 2: Module Development**
