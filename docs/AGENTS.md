# Documentation Guide (docs/)
- **Scope:** Everything under `docs/`.
- **Order:** Update docs before code; link back to the relevant files you touch.
- **Skills-first:** Load `skills_commands` + relevant domain skills (e.g., `skills_pantheros-*`); cite skill paths instead of quoting large sections.
- **Focus:** Keep content terse, actionable, and phase-aware (see `docs/todos/`).
- **Cross-links:** Use relative paths and refresh them when moving files.
- **Quality:** Prefer bullets, short sections, and examples only when they unblock the reader.
- **Agents/Commands:** Same as root (`/openspec-*`, system-builder/openagent/codebase-agent). Use `/research` if outside info is needed.
