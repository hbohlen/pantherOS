Your primary goal is to help users safely and efficiently, adhering strictly to the following instructions and utilizing your available tools.\n\n# Core Mandates\n\n- **Conventions:** Rigorously adhere to existing project conventions when reading or modifying code. Analyze surrounding code, tests, and configuration first.\n- **Libraries/Frameworks:** NEVER assume a library/framework is available or appropriate. Verify its established usage within the project (check imports, configuration files like 'package.json', 'Cargo.toml', 'requirements.txt', 'build.gradle', etc., or observe neighboring files) before employing it.\n- **Style & Structure:** Mimic the style (formatting, naming), structure, framework choices, typing, and architectural patterns of existing code in the project.\n- **Idiomatic Changes:** When editing, understand the local context (imports, functions/classes) to ensure your changes integrate naturally and idiomatically.\n- **Comments:** Add code comments sparingly. Focus on *why* something is done, especially for complex logic, rather than *what* is done. Only add high-value comments if necessary for clarity or if requested by the user. Do not edit comments that are separate from the code you are changing. *NEVER* talk to the user or describe your changes through comments.\n- **Proactiveness:** Fulfill the user's request thoroughly. When adding features or fixing bugs, this includes adding tests to ensure quality. Consider all created files, especially tests, to be permanent artifacts unless the user says otherwise.\n- **Confirm Ambiguity/Expansion:** Do not take significant actions beyond the clear scope of the request without confirming with the user. If asked *how* to do something, explain first, don't just do it.\n- **Explaining Changes:** After completing a code modification or file operation *do not* provide summaries unless asked.\n- **Path Construction:** Before using any file system tool (e.g., read_file' or 'write_file'), you must construct the full absolute path for the file_path argument. Always combine the absolute path of the project's root directory with the file's path relative to the root. For example, if the project root is /path/to/project/ and the file is foo/bar/baz.txt, the final path you must use is /path/to/project/foo/bar/baz.txt. If the user provides a relative path, you must resolve it against the root directory to create an absolute path.\n- **Do Not revert changes:** Do not revert changes to the codebase unless asked to do so by the user. Only revert changes made by you if they have resulted in an error or if the user has explicitly asked you to revert the changes.\n\n# Task Management\nYou have access to the todo_write tool to help you manage and plan tasks. Use these tools VERY frequently to ensure that you are tracking your tasks and giving the user visibility into your progress.\nThese tools are also EXTREMELY helpful for planning tasks, and for breaking down larger complex tasks into smaller steps. If you do not use this tool when planning, you may forget to do important tasks - and that is unacceptable.\n\nIt is critical that you mark todos as completed as soon as you are done with a task. Do not batch up multiple tasks before marking them as completed.\n\nExamples:\n\n<example>\nuser: Run the build and fix any type errors\nassistant: I'm going to use the todo_write tool to write the following items to the todo list: \n- Run the build\n- Fix any type errors\n\nI'm now going to run the build using Bash.\n\nLooks like I found 10 type errors. I'm going to use the todo_write tool to write 10 items to the todo list.\n\nmarking the first todo as in_progress\n\nLet me start working on the first item...\n\nThe first item has been fixed, let me mark the first todo as completed, and move on to the second item...\n..\n..\n</example>\nIn the above example, the assistant completes all the tasks, including the 10 error fixes and running the build and fixing all errors.\n\n<example>\nuser: Help me write a new feature that allows users to track their usage metrics and export them to various formats\n\nA: I'll help you implement a usage metrics tracking and export feature. Let me first use the todo_write tool to plan this task.\nAdding the following todos to the todo list:\n1. Research existing metrics tracking in the codebase\n2. Design the metrics collection system\n3. Implement core metrics tracking functionality\n4. Create export functionality for different formats\n\nLet me start by researching the existing codebase to understand what metrics we might already be tracking and how we can build on that.\n\nI'm going to search for any existing metrics or telemetry code in the project.\n\nI've found some existing telemetry code. Let me mark the first todo as in_progress and start designing our metrics tracking system based on what I've learned...\n\n[Assistant continues implementing the feature step by step, marking todos as in_progress and completed as they go]\n</example>\n\n\n# Primary Workflows\n\n## Software Engineering Tasks\nWhen requested to perform tasks like fixing bugs, adding features, refactoring, or explaining code, follow this iterative approach:\n- **Plan:** After understanding the user's request, create an initial plan based on your existing knowledge and any immediately obvious context. Use the 'todo_write' tool to capture this rough plan for complex or multi-step work. Don't wait for complete understanding - start with what you know.\n- **Implement:** Begin implementing the plan while gathering additional context as needed. Use 'grep_search', 'glob', 'read_file', and 'read_many_files' tools strategically when you encounter specific unknowns during implementation. Use the available tools (e.g., 'edit', 'write_file' 'run_shell_command' ...) to act on the plan, strictly adhering to the project's established conventions (detailed under 'Core Mandates').\n- **Adapt:** As you discover new information or encounter obstacles, update your plan and todos accordingly. Mark todos as in_progress when starting and completed when finishing each task. Add new todos if the scope expands. Refine your approach based on what you learn.\n- **Verify (Tests):** If applicable and feasible, verify the changes using the project's testing procedures. Identify the correct test commands and frameworks by examining 'README' files, build/package configuration (e.g., 'package.json'), or existing test execution patterns. NEVER assume standard test commands.\n- **Verify (Standards):** VERY IMPORTANT: After making code changes, execute the project-specific build, linting and type-checking commands (e.g., 'tsc', 'npm run lint', 'ruff check .') that you have identified for this project (or obtained from the user). This ensures code quality and adherence to standards. If unsure about these commands, you can ask the user if they'd like you to run them and if so how to.\n\n**Key Principle:** Start with a reasonable plan based on available information, then adapt as you learn. Users prefer seeing progress quickly rather than waiting for perfect understanding.\n\n- Tool results and user messages may include <system-reminder> tags. <system-reminder> tags contain useful information and reminders. They are NOT part of the user's provided input or the tool result.\n\nIMPORTANT: Always use the todo_write tool to plan and track tasks throughout the conversation.\n\n## New Applications\n\n**Goal:** Autonomously implement and deliver a visually appealing, substantially complete, and functional prototype. Utilize all tools at your disposal to implement the application. Some tools you may especially find useful are 'write_file', 'edit' and 'run_shell_command'.\n\n1. **Understand Requirements:** Analyze the user's request to identify core features, desired user experience (UX), visual aesthetic, application type/platform (web, mobile, desktop, CLI, library, 2D or 3D game), and explicit constraints. If critical information for initial planning is missing or ambiguous, ask concise, targeted clarification questions.\n2. **Propose Plan:** Formulate an internal development plan. Present a clear, concise, high-level summary to the user. This summary must effectively convey the application's type and core purpose, key technologies to be used, main features and how users will interact with them, and the general approach to the visual design and user experience (UX) with the intention of delivering something beautiful, modern, and polished, especially for UI-based applications. For applications requiring visual assets (like games or rich UIs), briefly describe the strategy for sourcing or generating placeholders (e.g., simple geometric shapes, procedurally generated patterns, or open-source assets if feasible and licenses permit) to ensure a visually complete initial prototype. Ensure this information is presented in a structured and easily digestible manner.\n  - When key technologies aren't specified, prefer the following:\n  - **Websites (Frontend):** React (JavaScript/TypeScript) with Bootstrap CSS, incorporating Material Design principles for UI/UX.\n  - **Back-End APIs:** Node.js with Express.js (JavaScript/TypeScript) or Python with FastAPI.\n  - **Full-stack:** Next.js (React/Node.js) using Bootstrap CSS and Material Design principles for the frontend, or Python (Django/Flask) for the backend with a React/Vue.js frontend styled with Bootstrap CSS and Material Design principles.\n  - **CLIs:** Python or Go.\n  - **Mobile App:** Compose Multiplatform (Kotlin Multiplatform) or Flutter (Dart) using Material Design libraries and principles, when sharing code between Android and iOS. Jetpack Compose (Kotlin JVM) with Material Design principles or SwiftUI (Swift) for native apps targeted at either Android or iOS, respectively.\n  - **3d Games:** HTML/CSS/JavaScript with Three.js.\n  - **2d Games:** HTML/CSS/JavaScript.\n3. **User Approval:** Obtain user approval for the proposed plan.\n4. **Implementation:** Use the 'todo_write' tool to convert the approved plan into a structured todo list with specific, actionable tasks, then autonomously implement each task utilizing all available tools. When starting ensure you scaffold the application using 'run_shell_command' for commands like 'npm init', 'npx create-react-app'. Aim for full scope completion. Proactively create or source necessary placeholder assets (e.g., images, icons, game sprites, 3D models using basic primitives if complex assets are not generatable) to ensure the application is visually coherent and functional, minimizing reliance on the user to provide these. If the model can generate simple assets (e.g., a uniformly colored square sprite, a simple 3D cube), it should do so. Otherwise, it should clearly indicate what kind of placeholder has been used and, if absolutely necessary, what the user might replace it with. Use placeholders only when essential for progress, intending to replace them with more refined versions or instruct the user on replacement during polishing if generation is not feasible.\n5. **Verify:** Review work against the original request, the approved plan. Fix bugs, deviations, and all placeholders where feasible, or ensure placeholders are visually adequate for a prototype. Ensure styling, interactions, produce a high-quality, functional and beautiful prototype aligned with design goals. Finally, but MOST importantly, build the application and ensure there are no compile errors.\n6. **Solicit Feedback:** If still applicable, provide instructions on how to start the application and request user feedback on the prototype.\n\n# Operational Guidelines\n\n## Tone and Style (CLI Interaction)\n- **Concise & Direct:** Adopt a professional, direct, and concise tone suitable for a CLI environment.\n- **Minimal Output:** Aim for fewer than 3 lines of text output (excluding tool use/code generation) per response whenever practical. Focus strictly on the user's query.\n- **Clarity over Brevity (When Needed):** While conciseness is key, prioritize clarity for essential explanations or when seeking necessary clarification if a request is ambiguous.\n- **No Chitchat:** Avoid conversational filler, preambles (\"Okay, I will now...\"), or postambles (\"I have finished the changes...\"). Get straight to the action or answer.\n- **Formatting:** Use GitHub-flavored Markdown. Responses will be rendered in monospace.\n- **Tools vs. Text:** Use tools for actions, text output *only* for communication. Do not add explanatory comments within tool calls or code blocks unless specifically part of the required code/command itself.\n- **Handling Inability:** If unable/unwilling to fulfill a request, state so briefly (1-2 sentences) without excessive justification. Offer alternatives if appropriate.\n\n## Security and Safety Rules\n- **Explain Critical Commands:** Before executing commands with 'run_shell_command' that modify the file system, codebase, or system state, you *must* provide a brief explanation of the command's purpose and potential impact. Prioritize user understanding and safety. You should not ask permission to use the tool; the user will be presented with a confirmation dialogue upon use (you do not need to tell them this).\n- **Security First:** Always apply security best practices. Never introduce code that exposes, logs, or commits secrets, API keys, or other sensitive information.\n\n## Tool Usage\n- **File Paths:** Always use absolute paths when referring to files with tools like 'read_file' or 'write_file'. Relative paths are not supported. You must provide an absolute path.\n- **Parallelism:** Execute multiple independent tool calls in parallel when feasible (i.e. searching the codebase).\n- **Command Execution:** Use the 'run_shell_command' tool for running shell commands, remembering the safety rule to explain modifying commands first.\n- **Background Processes:** Use background processes (via `&`) for commands that are unlikely to stop on their own, e.g. `node server.js &`. If unsure, ask the user.\n- **Interactive Commands:** Try to avoid shell commands that are likely to require user interaction (e.g. `git rebase -i`). Use non-interactive versions of commands (e.g. `npm init -y` instead of `npm init`) when available, and otherwise remind the user that interactive shell commands are not supported and may cause hangs until canceled by the user.\n- **Task Management:** Use the 'todo_write' tool proactively for complex, multi-step tasks to track progress and provide visibility to users. This tool helps organize work systematically and ensures no requirements are missed.\n- **Subagent Delegation:** When doing file search, prefer to use the 'task' tool in order to reduce context usage. You should proactively use the 'task' tool with specialized agents when the task at hand matches the agent's description.\n- **Remembering Facts:** Use the 'save_memory' tool to remember specific, *user-related* facts or preferences when the user explicitly asks, or when they state a clear, concise piece of information that would help personalize or streamline *your future interactions with them* (e.g., preferred coding style, common project paths they use, personal tool aliases). This tool is for user-specific information that should persist across sessions. Do *not* use it for general project context or information. If unsure whether to save something, you can ask the user, \"Should I remember that for you?\"\n- **Respect User Confirmations:** Most tool calls (also denoted as 'function calls') will first require confirmation from the user, where they will either approve or cancel the function call. If a user cancels a function call, respect their choice and do _not_ try to make the function call again. It is okay to request the tool call again _only_ if the user requests that same tool call on a subsequent prompt. When a user cancels a function call, assume best intentions from the user and consider inquiring if they prefer any alternative paths forward.\n\n## Interaction Details\n- **Help Command:** The user can use '/help' to display help information.\n- **Feedback:** To report a bug or provide feedback, please use the /bug command.\n\n\n# Outside of Sandbox\nYou are running outside of a sandbox container, directly on the user's system. For critical commands that are particularly likely to modify the user's system outside of the project directory or system temp directory, as you explain the command to the user (per the Explain Critical Commands rule above), also remind the user to consider enabling sandboxing.\n\n\n\n# Git Repository\n- The current working (project) directory is being managed by a git repository.\n- When asked to commit changes or prepare a commit, always start by gathering information using shell commands:\n  - `git status` to ensure that all relevant files are tracked and staged, using `git add ...` as needed.\n  - `git diff HEAD` to review all changes (including unstaged changes) to tracked files in work tree since last commit.\n    - `git diff --staged` to review only staged changes when a partial commit makes sense or was requested by the user.\n  - `git log -n 3` to review recent commit messages and match their style (verbosity, formatting, signature line, etc.)\n- Combine shell commands whenever possible to save time/steps, e.g. `git status && git diff HEAD && git log -n 3`.\n- Always propose a draft commit message. Never just ask the user to give you the full commit message.\n- Prefer commit messages that are clear, concise, and focused more on \"why\" and less on \"what\".\n- Keep the user informed and ask for clarification or confirmation where needed.\n- After each commit, confirm that it was successful by running `git status`.\n- If a commit fails, never attempt to work around the issues without being asked to do so.\n- Never push changes to a remote repository without being asked explicitly by the user.\n\n\n# Examples (Illustrating Tone and Workflow)\n<example>\nuser: 1 + 2\nmodel: 3\n</example>\n\n<example>\nuser: is 13 a prime number?\nmodel: true\n</example>\n\n<example>\nuser: start the server implemented in server.js\nmodel: \n<tool_call>\n<function=run_shell_command>\n<parameter=command>\nnode server.js &\n</parameter>\n</function>\n</tool_call>\n</example>\n\n<example>\nuser: Refactor the auth logic in src/auth.py to use the requests library instead of urllib.\nmodel: Okay, I can refactor 'src/auth.py'.\nFirst, I'll analyze the code and check for a test safety net before planning any changes.\n<tool_call>\n<function=glob>\n<parameter=path>\ntests/test_auth.py\n</parameter>\n</function>\n</tool_call>\n<tool_call>\n<function=read_file>\n<parameter=path>\n/path/to/tests/test_auth.py\n</parameter>\n<parameter=offset>\n0\n</parameter>\n<parameter=limit>\n10\n</parameter>\n</function>\n</tool_call>\n(After analysis)\nGreat, 'tests/test_auth.py' exists and covers the core authentication logic.

Which one would you like to start with, or should I read all of them?\n</example>\n\n# Final Reminder\nYour core function is efficient and safe assistance. Balance extreme conciseness with the crucial need for clarity, especially regarding safety and potential system modifications. Always prioritize user control and project conventions. Never make assumptions about the contents of files; instead use 'read_file' or 'read_many_files' to ensure you aren't making broad assumptions. Finally, you are an agent - please keep going until the user's query is completely resolved.\n\n---\n\n--- Context from: QWEN.md ---\n<!-- OPENSPEC:START -->\n# OpenSpec Instructions\n\nThese instructions are for AI assistants working in this project.\n\nAlways open `@/openspec/AGENTS.md` when the request:\n- Mentions planning or proposals (words like proposal, spec, change, plan)\n- Introduces new capabilities, breaking changes, architecture shifts, or big performance/security work\n- Sounds ambiguous and you need the authoritative spec before coding\n\nUse `@/openspec/AGENTS.md` to learn:\n- How to create and apply change proposals\n- Spec format and conventions\n- Project structure and guidelines\n\nKeep this managed block so 'openspec update' can refresh the instructions.\n\n<!-- OPENSPEC:END -->\n--- End of Context from: QWEN.md ---",

A module is a file containing a Nix expression with a specific structure. It declares options for other modules to define (give a value). It processes them and defines options declared in other modules.[1]\n\nFor example, /etc/nixos/configuration.nix is a module. Most other modules are in ﻿nixos/modules.\n\nModules were introduced to allow extending NixOS without modifying its source code.[2] They also allow splitting up configuration.nix, making the system configuration easier to maintain and to reuse.\n\n\nCONTENTS\n\n * 1 Structure\n   * 1.1 Function\n   * 1.2 Imports\n     * 1.2.1 Example\n     * 1.2.2 modulesPath\n     * 1.2.3 Module Imports vs builtins-imports\n   * 1.3 Declarations (options)\n     * 1.3.1 Examples\n       * 1.3.1.1 Simple Enable option\n     * 1.3.2 Shorthand\n * 2 Full Example\n * 3 Advanced Use Cases\n   * 3.1 Compatibility Issues with Different Nixpkgs Versions\n   * 3.2 Abstract imports\n   * 3.3 Using external NixOS modules\n   * 3.4 disabledModules attribute\n * 4 Under the hood\n * 5 More complex usages\n * 6 Developing modules\n   * 6.1 With Flakes\n * 7 References\n * 8 See also\n\n\nSTRUCTURE\n\nModules have the following syntax:\n\n{\n  imports = [\n    # Paths to other modules.\n    # Compose this module out of smaller ones.\n  ];\n\n  options = {\n    # Option declarations.\n    # Declare what settings a user of this module can set.\n    # Usually this includes a global \"enable\" option which defaults to false.\n  };\n\n  config = {\n    # Option definitions.\n    # Define what other settings, services and resources should be active.\n    # Usually these depend on whether a user of this module chose to \"enable\" it\n    # using the \"option\" above. \n    # Options for modules imported in \"imports\" can be set here.\n  };\n}\n\n\n\nFUNCTION\n\nA module can be turned into a function accepting an attribute set.\n\n{ config, pkgs, ... }:\n{\n  imports = [];\n  # ...\n}\n\n\nIt may require the attribute set to contain:\n\nconfig The configuration of the entire system. options All option declarations refined with all definition and declaration references. pkgs The attribute set extracted from the Nix package collection and enhanced with the nixpkgs.config option. modulesPath The location of the module directory of NixOS.\n\n\nIMPORTS\n\nImports are paths to other NixOS modules that should be included in the evaluation of the system configuration. A default set of modules is defined in ﻿nixos/modules/module-list.nix. These don't need to be added in the import list.\n\nEXAMPLE\n\n{\n  imports = [\n    # Paths to other modules.\n    \n    # They can be relative paths \n    ./otherModule.nix\n    \n    # Or absolute\n    /path/to/otherModule.nix\n  ];\n}\n\n\nMODULESPATH\n\nSome modules use modulesPath to import NixOS libraries.\n\nFor example ﻿nixos/modules/virtualisation/digital-ocean-config.nix:\n\n{ config, pkgs, lib, modulesPath, ... }:\n  imports = [\n    (modulesPath + \"/profiles/qemu-guest.nix\")\n    (modulesPath + \"/virtualisation/digital-ocean-init.nix\")\n  ];\n\n\nThe Nix variable modulesPath is parsed from the environment variable NIX_PATH.\n\nWhen NIX_PATH is empty, Nix can throw the error undefined variable 'modulesPath'.\n\nNIX_PATH should look something like this:\n\n$ echo $NIX_PATH | tr : '\\n' \nnixpkgs=/nix/var/nix/profiles/per-user/root/channels/nixos\nnixos-config=/etc/nixos/configuration.nix\n/nix/var/nix/profiles/per-user/root/channels\n\n\nHere, the modulesPath is /nix/var/nix/profiles/per-user/root/channels.\n\nWhen a Nix expression calls import <nixpkgs>,\nNix will load /nix/var/nix/profiles/per-user/root/channels/nixos.\n\nMODULE IMPORTS VS BUILTINS-IMPORTS\n\nBeginners often confuse the modules attribute imports = [./module.nix] here with the Nix builtins function import module.nix. The first expects a path to a file containing a NixOS module (having the same specific structure we're describing here), while the second loads whatever Nix expression is in that file (no expected structure). See this post.\n\nNote: imports provides the same behavior as the obsolete require. There is no reason to use require anymore, however it may still linger in some legacy code.\n\n\nDECLARATIONS (OPTIONS)\n\nDeclarations specify a module's external interfaces.\n\noptionName = mkOption {\n  # ...\n}\n\n\nThey are created with mkOption, a function accepting a set with following attributes:[3][4]\n\ntype\n\nThe type of the option. It may be omitted, but that’s not advisable since it may lead to errors that are hard to diagnose. See NixOS:Declaration for more types\n\ndefault\n\nThe default value used if no value is defined by any module. A default is not required; but if a default is not given, then users of the module will have to define the value of the option, otherwise an error will be thrown.\n\nexample\n\nAn example value that will be shown in the NixOS manual.\n\ndescription\n\nA textual description of the option, in DocBook format, that will be included in the NixOS manual.\n\nThere are also some helper Option functions:\n\noptionName = mkEnableOption \"this cool module\";\n\n#this is the same as\n\noptionName = mkOption {\n  type = lib.types.bool;\n  default = false;\n  example = true;\n  description = \"Whether to enable this cool module.\";\n}\n\n\nEXAMPLES\n\nSIMPLE ENABLE OPTION\n\nIf you just want to be able to enable/disable a module you can define an Enable option like this:\n\n{ lib, config, ...}: \nlet cfg = config.myModule; in {\n  options = {\n    myModule.enable = lib.mkEnableOption \"Enable Module\";\n  };\n\n  config = lib.mkIf cfg.enable {\n    #config contents\n  }\n}\n\n\nSHORTHAND\n\nIf your module has no declarations there is a shorthand:\n\n{\n  imports = [\n    # Paths to other modules.\n  ];\n\n  # Config definitions.\n  services.othermodule.enable = true;\n  # ...\n  # Notice that you can leave out the \"config { }\" wrapper.\n}\n\n\n\nFULL EXAMPLE\n\nTo see how modules are setup and reuse other modules in practice put hello.nix in the same folder as your configuration.nix:\n\n\n\nhello.nix\n\n\n{ lib, pkgs, config, ... }:\nwith lib;                      \nlet\n  # Shorter name to access final settings a \n  # user of hello.nix module HAS ACTUALLY SET.\n  # cfg is a typical convention.\n  cfg = config.services.hello;\nin {\n  # Declare what settings a user of this \"hello.nix\" module CAN SET.\n  options.services.hello = {\n    enable = mkEnableOption \"hello service\";\n    greeter = mkOption {\n      type = types.str;\n      default = \"world\";\n    };\n  };\n\n  # Define what other settings, services and resources should be active IF\n  # a user of this \"hello.nix\" module ENABLED this module \n  # by setting \"services.hello.enable = true;\".\n  config = mkIf cfg.enable {\n    systemd.services.hello = {\n      wantedBy = [ \"multi-user.target\" ];\n      serviceConfig.ExecStart = \"${pkgs.hello}/bin/hello -g'Hello, ${escapeShellArg cfg.greeter}!'\";\n    };\n  };\n}\n\n\n\nThe other configuration.nix module can then import this hello.nix module and decide to enable it (and optionally set other allowed settings) as follows:\n\n\n\nconfiguration.nix\n\n\n{\n  imports = [ ./hello.nix ];\n  ...\n  services.hello = {\n    enable = true;\n    greeter = \"Bob\";\n  };\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\nADVANCED USE CASES\n\n\nCOMPATIBILITY ISSUES WITH DIFFERENT NIXPKGS VERSIONS\n\nModule options between Nixpkgs revisions can sometimes change in incompatible ways.\n\nFor example, the option services.nginx.virtualHosts.*.port in nixpkgs-17.03 was replaced by services.nginx.virtualHosts.*.listen in nixpkgs-17.09. If configuration.nix has to accommodate both variants, options can be inspected:\n\n{ options, ... }: {\n  services.nginx.virtualHosts.somehost = { /* common configuration */ }\n    // (if builtins.hasAttr \"port\" (builtins.head options.services.nginx.virtualHosts.type.getSubModules).submodule.options\n          then { port = 8000; }\n          else { listen = [ { addr = \"0.0.0.0\"; port = 8000; } ]; });\n}\n\n\n\nABSTRACT IMPORTS\n\nTo import a module that's stored somewhere (but for which you have neither an absolute nor a relative path), you can use NIX_PATH elements or specialArgs from ﻿nixos/lib/eval-config.nix.\n\nThis is useful for e.g. pulling modules from a git repository without adding it as a channel, or if you just prefer using paths relative to a root you can change (as opposed to the current file, which could move in the future).\n\nlet\n  inherit (import <nixpkgs> {}) writeShellScriptBin fetchgit;\n  yourModules = fetchgit { ... };\nin rec {\n  nixos = import <nixpkgs/nixos/lib/eval-config.nix> {\n    modules = [ ./configuration.nix ];\n    specialArgs.mod = name: \"${yourModules}/${name}\";\n  };\n\n  /* use NixOS here, e.g. for deployment or building an image */\n}\n\n\n{ config, lib, pkgs, mod, ... }: {\n  imports = [\n    (mod \"foo.nix\")\n  ];\n\n  ...\n}\n\n\n\nUSING EXTERNAL NIXOS MODULES\n\nSome external modules provide extra functionality to the NixOS module system. You can include these modules, after making them available as a file system path (e.g. through builtins.fetchTarball, by using imports = [ `path to module`] in your configuration.nix.\n\n * Nixsap - allows to run multiple instances of a service without containers.\n * musnix - real-time audio in NixOS.\n * nixos-mailserver - full-featured mail server module\n * X-Truder Nix-profiles - modules for Nix to quickly configure your system based on application profiles.\n\n\nDISABLEDMODULES ATTRIBUTE\n\nYou can disable modules by using the top-level attribute disabledModules. This is useful for disabling modules from Nixpkgs or NixOS. This can also be used to override modules that have the same name (Ex: You want to override a module from NixOS with your own implementation). More info\n\ndisabledModules is a top level attribute just like the imports or options of the module.\n\n{ config, lib, pkgs, ... }:\n\n{\n  disabledModules = [ \"./helloWorld.nix\" ];\n\n  imports =\n    [ \n      ./helloWorld.nix\n    ];\n\n  #This does nothing because ./helloWorld is disabled\n  services.helloWorld.enable = true;\n}\n\n\n\nUNDER THE HOOD\n\nThe following was taken from a comment by Infinisil on Reddit:[5]\n\nA NixOS system is described by a single system derivation. nixos-rebuild builds this derivation with\n\n$ nix-build '<nixpkgs/nixos>' -A system\n\nand then switches to that system with\n\n$ result/bin/switch-to-configuration\n\nThe entrypoint is the file at '<nixpkgs/nixos>' (./default.nix), which defines the system attribute to be the NixOS option system.build.toplevel. This toplevel option is the topmost level of the NixOS evaluation and it's what almost all options eventually end up influencing through potentially a number of intermediate options.\n\nAs an example:\n\n * The high-level option services.nginx.enable uses the lower-level option systemd.services.nginx\n * Which in turn uses the even-lower-level option systemd.units.\"nginx.service\"\n * Which in turn uses environment.etc.\"systemd/system\"\n * Which then ends up as result/etc/systemd/system/nginx.service in the top-level derivation\n\nSo high-level options use lower-level ones, eventually ending up at system.build.toplevel.\n\nHow do these options get evaluated though? That's what the NixOS module system does, which lives in the ./lib directory (in modules.nix, options.nix and types.nix). The module system can even be used without NixOS, allowing you to use it for your own option sets. Here's a simple example of this, whose toplevel option you can evaluate with\n\n$ nix-instantiate --eval file.nix -A config.toplevel\n\nlet\n  systemModule = { lib, config, ... }: {\n    options.toplevel = lib.mkOption {\n      type = lib.types.str;\n    };\n\n    options.enableFoo = lib.mkOption {\n      type = lib.types.bool;\n      default = false;\n    };\n\n    config.toplevel = ''\n      Is foo enabled? ${lib.boolToString config.enableFoo}\n    '';\n  };\n\n  userModule = {\n    enableFoo = true;\n  };\n\nin (import <nixpkgs/lib>).evalModules {\n  modules = [ systemModule userModule ];\n}\n\n\nThe module system itself is rather complex, but here's a short overview. A module evaluation consists of a set of \"modules\", which can do three things:\n\n * Import other modules (through imports = [ ./other-module.nix ];)\n * Declare options (through options = { ... };)\n * Define option values (through config = { ... };, or without the config key as a shorthand if you don't have imports or options)\n\nTo do the actual evaluation, there's these rough steps:\n\n * Recursively collect all modules by looking at all imports statements\n * Collect all option declarations (with options) of all modules and merge them together if necessary\n * For each option, evaluate it by collecting all its definitions (with config) from all modules and merging them together according to the options type.\n\nNote that the last step is lazy (only the options you need are evaluated) and depends on other options itself (all the ones that influence it).\n\n\nMORE COMPLEX USAGES\n\nThe examples below contain:\n\n * a child mkOption inherits their default from a parent mkOption\n * reading default values from neighbouring mkOption(s) for conditional defaults\n * passing in the config, to read the hostName from a submodule (email system)\n * setting default values from attrset (email system)\n * generating documentation for custom modules (outside of Nixpkgs). See here\n\nSource:\n\n * https://github.com/nixcloud/nixcloud-webservices/blob/master/modules/services/reverse-proxy/default.nix\n * https://github.com/nixcloud/nixcloud-webservices/blob/master/modules/services/reverse-proxy/options.nix\n * https://github.com/nixcloud/nixcloud-webservices/blob/master/modules/services/TLS/default.nix\n * https://github.com/nixcloud/nixcloud-webservices/blob/master/modules/services/email/nixcloud-email.nix#L114\n\n(sorry, don't have more time to make this into a nice little guide yet, but these links should be pretty good introductions into more advanced module system usages) qknight\n\n\nDEVELOPING MODULES\n\nTo test your module out, you can run the following from a local checkout of Nixpkgs with a copy of a configuration.nix:\n\n$ nixos-rebuild build-vm --fast -I nixos-config=./configuration.nix -I nixpkgs=.\n\n\nIf you're developing on top of master, this will potentially cause the compilation of lots of packages, since changes on master might not cached on cache.nixos.org yet. To avoid that, you can develop your module on top of the nixos-unstable channel, tracked by the eponymous branch in https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs:\n\n$ git checkout -b mymodule upstream/nixos-unstable\n\n\n\nWITH FLAKES\n\nIf you're developing a module from Nixpkgs, you can try and follow the directions here: https://github.com/Misterio77/nix-starter-configs/issues/28.\n\nIf you want to develop a module from a git repo, you can use --override-input. For example, if you have an input in your flake called jovian, you can use\n\n$ nixos-rebuild switch --override-input jovian <path-to-url> --flake <uri>\n\n\nOf course, it doesn't have to be nixos-rebuild in particular.\n\n\nREFERENCES\n\n 1. ↑ NixOS Manual, Chapter 42.

          "content": "Based on the information from the NixOS Wiki, I'll extract and provide detailed information about the NixOS module system organization, focusing on the aspects you mentioned. Let me first create a plan for organizing this information.\n\nI'll focus on the following aspects as requested:\n1. Using default.nix in subdirectories for auto-import\n2. Single-purpose module files\n3. Modular directory structure\n\nLooking at the content provided, there's information about the module system structure and imports, but specific details about using default.nix in subdirectories for auto-import aren't explicitly mentioned. However, I can provide detailed information about the overall module system organization based on the content.\n\nLet me elaborate on the key aspects of the NixOS module system organization:\n\n## Module System Structure\n\nIn NixOS, modules are the building blocks that allow for a modular system configuration. Each module follows a specific structure:\n\n```nix\n{\n  imports = [\n    # Paths to other modules.\n    # Compose this module out of smaller ones.\n  ];\n\n  options = {\n    # Option declarations.\n    # Declare what settings a user of this module can set.\n    # Usually this includes a global \"enable\" option which defaults to false.\n  };\n\n  config = {\n    # Option definitions.\n    # Define what other settings, services and resources should be active.\n    # Usually these depend on whether a user of this module chose to \"enable\" it\n    # using the \"option\" above. \n    # Options for modules imported in \"imports\" can be set here.\n  };\n}\n```\n\n## Imports and Organization\n\nModules can import other modules using the `imports` attribute:\n\n```nix\n{\n  imports = [\n    # Paths to other modules.\n    \n    # They can be relative paths \n    ./otherModule.nix\n    \n    # Or absolute\n    /path/to/otherModule.nix\n  ];\n}\n```\n\nMost modules in NixOS are located in `nixos/modules`, and there's a default set of modules defined in `nixos/modules/module-list.nix` that don't need to be added to the import list.\n\n## Single-Purpose Module Files\n\nThe NixOS module system encourages single-purpose modules. Each module file typically handles a specific service or feature. For example, the documentation includes an example of a `hello.nix` module that handles a single service:\n\n```nix\n{ lib, pkgs, config, ... }:\nwith lib;                      \nlet\n  # Shorter name to access final settings a \n  # user of hello.nix module HAS ACTUALLY SET.\n  # cfg is a typical convention.\n  cfg = config.services.hello;\nin {\n  # Declare what settings a user of this \"hello.nix\" module CAN SET.\n  options.services.hello = {\n    enable = mkEnableOption \"hello service\";\n    greeter = mkOption {\n      type = types.str;\n      default = \"world\";\n    };\n  };\n\n  # Define what other settings, services and resources should be active IF\n  # a user of this \"hello.nix\" module ENABLED this module \n  # by setting \"services.hello.enable = true;\".\n  config = mkIf cfg.enable {\n    systemd.services.hello = {\n      wantedBy = [ \"multi-user.target\" ];\n      serviceConfig.ExecStart = \"${pkgs.hello}/bin/hello -g'Hello, ${escapeShellArg cfg.greeter}!'\";\n    };\n  };\n}\n```\n\n## Modular Directory Structure\n\nThe NixOS codebase follows a modular directory structure with modules organized by functionality:\n\n- Core system modules are in `nixos/modules`\n- Modules are organized by category (e.g., `services`, `hardware`, `virtualisation`, etc.)\n- The `modulesPath` variable provides access to the module directory location\n\nSome modules use `modulesPath` to import NixOS libraries:\n\n```nix\n{ config, pkgs, lib, modulesPath, ... }:\n  imports = [\n    (modulesPath + \"/profiles/qemu-guest.nix\")\n    (modulesPath + \"/virtualisation/digital-ocean-init.nix\")\n  ];\n```\n\nNote that while the information provided doesn't explicitly detail the use of `default.nix` files in subdirectories for auto-import, the module system is designed to be modular and hierarchical with modules importing other modules. The `imports` attribute in modules allows for composing functionality from multiple sources, creating a tree-like structure.\n\nThe module system also includes advanced features like:\n- Compatibility handling between different Nixpkgs versions\n- Abstract imports using specialArgs\n- The ability to disable modules with the `disabledModules` attribute\n\nThis design allows for a highly modular system where functionality can be composed from multiple smaller, focused modules, following the principle of single-purpose module files."
